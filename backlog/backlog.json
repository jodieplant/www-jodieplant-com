Placeholder case studies with fabricated metrics actively harm credibility. This page uses real credentials and methodology to demonstrate expertise.\n\nSections:\n\n1. HERO: Cabinet Grotesk headline 'What You Can Expect'. Subhead: honest framing — 'I don't have a portfolio of logos to hide behind. Here's what I bring instead — real experience, a proven approach, and the results to back it up.'\n\n2. CREDENTIALS & NUMBERS: Real, provable stats in Space Grotesk at large scale — years experience, campaigns/projects delivered, ad spend managed, client retention, industries worked with. MUST be real. Small but honest beats large but fabricated. Add OUTCOME RANGE ANCHORS (generalized, historical patterns — not client-specific): e.g. 'Increased demo bookings 30–120% in 90 days', 'Reduced cost per lead 18–40%', 'Doubled organic visibility in 6–12 months'. Frame as 'What I've seen across engagements' or 'Typical outcome ranges' to make methodology tangible.\n\n3. THE APPROACH IN ACTION: Instead of fake case studies, show methodology applied:\n- 'What a typical SEO engagement looks like' — month-by-month\n- 'How I'd approach a startup launch campaign' — step-by-step\n- 'What a monthly retainer delivers' — concrete deliverables\nDemonstrates expertise without fabricating results.\n\n3b. 'PEEK UNDER THE HOOD' — VISUAL PROCESS PROOF:\nDon't just list what you do — VISUALIZE the workflow. Prospects are skeptical of AI claims. Show actual artifacts:\n- Blurred/redacted screenshot of an AI-enhanced research workflow or audit output\n- Sample 'AI Visibility Report' structure (designed mockup with real formatting, anonymized data)\n- Before/after of an AI-optimized content piece\n- Dashboard screenshot showing type of reporting (redacted data)\nUse subtle frame/border treatment to make these feel like real documents. This section is the most powerful differentiator on the page — it proves Jodie is a systems builder, not just a prompt engineer.\n\n4. WHAT CLIENTS SAY: Real testimonials, LinkedIn recommendations, or professional endorsements. Even 1-2 is better than none. If no client testimonials exist: results from past roles with appropriate framing. Structure ready for adding real testimonials later.\n\n5. INDUSTRIES & EXPERIENCE: Types of companies Jodie works with — SaaS, fintech, dev tools, etc. Pattern recognition: 'I've seen what works for companies like yours.'\n\n6.

      "description": "When calendar booking (Cal.com/Calendly) is live, add optional gating logic: require or strongly encourage completing the free audit (or AI Visibility Audit) before booking a call. E.g. calendar link on /contact could go to a short landing message: 'Best results when we've reviewed your marketing first — get your free audit, then book a call to discuss.' Or: only show calendar link after form submission. Reduces low-quality calls and aligns with conversion ladder. Phase 2 — after FEAT-014 (Cal.com integration). Per synthesis review: Calendly gating logic.",

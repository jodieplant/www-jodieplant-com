Most marketing advice is written for companies with budgets, teams, and products that already have traction. If you're at seed stage, that advice will actively hurt you.

I've watched dozens of seed-stage founders burn through runway on marketing playbooks designed for companies two stages ahead of them. They hire a Head of Marketing before they have a repeatable sales motion. They pour money into paid ads before they understand who actually buys their product. They build a content machine before they have anything worth saying.

Seed-stage marketing is not a scaled-down version of growth-stage marketing. It is a fundamentally different discipline. The goal isn't demand generation -- it's learning. And the strategy you need reflects that.

## Why Seed Stage Is Different

At seed stage, you're operating under radical uncertainty. You probably have a hypothesis about your market, your customer, and why they'll care. But you haven't validated most of it. Your product is evolving. Your positioning is a guess. Your ICP is a sketch on a whiteboard.

In this environment, the traditional marketing playbook -- build funnel, drive traffic, optimize conversion -- is premature. You don't have a funnel. You have a series of experiments.

The job of marketing at seed stage is to compress the time it takes to learn three things:

1. **Who actually wants this?** Not who you think wants it. Who demonstrates demand with their behaviour -- their clicks, their sign-ups, their willingness to get on a call.
2. **What language resonates?** The words your customers use to describe their problem are rarely the words you use to describe your solution.
3. **Which channels connect you to those people?** Not which channels are popular. Which channels put you in front of the specific humans who have the problem you solve.

Everything else -- brand campaigns, sophisticated attribution, marketing automation -- comes later. If you try to build that infrastructure now, you'll build it on assumptions. And when those assumptions turn out to be wrong (they will), you'll have to tear it all down.

## The Mistakes That Kill Momentum

**Hiring a senior marketer too early.** A great Head of Marketing needs a strategy to execute. At seed stage, the strategy doesn't exist yet -- it needs to be discovered. Hiring someone whose skill set is execution and scaling, then asking them to figure out product-market fit, is a mismatch. You need a strategist or a scrappy generalist, not a team builder.

**Spending on paid ads before product-market fit.** Paid acquisition is an accelerant. It takes what's already working and makes it work faster. If you don't know your conversion rate, your average deal value, or your customer acquisition cost, paid ads are just an expensive way to generate confusing data. I've seen startups spend $30K on Google Ads and conclude "marketing doesn't work for us" when the real problem was their landing page spoke to the wrong audience.

**Building brand before you have clarity.** I love brand work. It matters enormously. But a $40K rebrand at seed stage is almost always wasted because your positioning will shift as you learn more about your market. Start with "good enough" -- clean, professional, consistent -- and invest in brand once your messaging has stabilised.

**Copying what worked for someone else.** That viral product-led growth motion you read about on Twitter? It worked because of a specific combination of product, market, and timing that almost certainly doesn't apply to you. Strategy is contextual. Steal frameworks, not tactics.

## The 4-Step Approach

Here's the framework I use with seed-stage clients. It's not glamorous, but it works.

### Step 1: Understand Your Market (Weeks 1-3)

Before you create a single piece of content or spend a pound on ads, do the homework. Talk to customers and prospects. Read the forums, subreddits, and Slack communities where they hang out. Analyse what your competitors say and, more importantly, what their customers say about them in reviews.

You're looking for three things: the language people use to describe the problem, the triggers that make them start looking for a solution, and the objections that stop them from buying. This research will save you months of wasted effort.

### Step 2: Build the Foundation (Weeks 3-6)

With research in hand, build the minimum viable marketing infrastructure:

- **Positioning statement.** One paragraph that explains who you're for, what you do, and why it matters. Test it on ten people. If they don't immediately get it, rewrite it.
- **Website.** Not a masterpiece. A clear homepage, a compelling product or service page, and a way to convert interest into a conversation. That's it.
- **Tracking.** Set up analytics so you can see where visitors come from and what they do. You can't learn from experiments you don't measure.

Resist the temptation to build more than this. Every page you create is a page you'll need to update when your positioning evolves.

### Step 3: Test Channels (Weeks 6-14)

Pick two or three channels and run focused experiments. The channels you choose depend on your business, but for most B2B startups I'd start with:

- **LinkedIn organic.** Founder-led content that shares genuine insight about the problem space. Not thought leadership fluff -- real observations from building the product and talking to customers.
- **Cold outreach.** Direct, personalised messages to people who match your ICP. Not spam. Thoughtful outreach that demonstrates you understand their world.
- **One paid channel.** A small budget ($2-5K) on whichever platform your audience uses most, testing 3-4 different messages to see which resonates.

Run each experiment for at least 4-6 weeks. Anything shorter and you're measuring noise, not signal.

### Step 4: Iterate (Ongoing)

Look at the data. Which messages got responses? Which channels drove conversations (not just clicks)? Where did qualified leads actually come from?

Double down on what works. Cut what doesn't. Adjust your positioning based on what you've learned. Then run the next round of experiments.

This isn't a linear process. You'll loop back to Step 1 regularly as you learn things that challenge your assumptions. That's not failure -- that's the whole point.

## What to Budget

I'm often asked "what should a seed-stage startup spend on marketing?" The honest answer is: as little as possible, allocated as strategically as possible.

A realistic range for a seed-stage startup doing marketing seriously:

- **Agency or fractional support:** $3-6K/month for strategic guidance and execution support
- **Paid media testing:** $2-5K/month, but only after Steps 1-2 are solid
- **Tools:** $200-500/month for analytics, email, and basic automation
- **Content production:** $1-3K/month if you're outsourcing writing or design

Total: roughly $6-14K per month, depending on how much you do in-house. If that number makes you wince, start with just the strategy support and founder-led content. You can do a lot with $4K/month and a founder who's willing to post on LinkedIn three times a week.

## When to Bring in Help

Do it yourself if you have a technical co-founder who genuinely enjoys talking to customers and writing about what they learn. Some founders are natural marketers. If that's you, a good strategist to gut-check your thinking is all you need.

Bring in help if marketing keeps sliding to the bottom of your to-do list, if you've been "about to start marketing" for three months, or if you've tried a few things and can't figure out why they're not working. A good fractional marketer or specialist agency will compress your learning curve dramatically.

The key word is "good." At seed stage, you need someone who's comfortable with ambiguity, who will challenge your assumptions, and who measures success in learning velocity, not vanity metrics. If an agency pitches you a 12-month content calendar in the first meeting, walk away. They're selling you a plan built on guesses.

Seed-stage marketing is unglamorous work. It's research, experimentation, and honest conversation about what the data actually says. But get it right, and everything that comes after -- your Series A fundraise, your first marketing hire, your growth strategy -- is built on a foundation of real insight rather than expensive assumptions.

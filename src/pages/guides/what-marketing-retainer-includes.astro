    question: 'How long is a typical marketing retainer commitment?',
    answer: 'At Jodie Plant Marketing, there are no long-term lock-in contracts. Retainers run month-to-month with 30 days notice to cancel. That said, marketing results compound over time — SEO and content strategies typically need 3-6 months to show meaningful ROI. I recommend committing to at least a 3-month engagement mentally, even if the contract doesn\'t require it, so the strategy has time to work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I need to pause my retainer?',
    answer: 'Life happens — funding delays, pivots, seasonal slowdowns. If you need to pause, give 30 days notice. We\'ll wrap up in-progress work, deliver final reports, and document everything so you can pick up where you left off. There are no pause fees or penalties. Some clients pause for a month or two and come back when they\'re ready.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is ad spend included in the retainer price?',
    answer: 'No — retainer fees cover strategy, management, and execution. Ad spend (the money paid directly to Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.) is separate and goes directly to the platforms. This keeps things transparent: you always know exactly what you\'re paying for management versus media. I\'ll help you set the right ad budget based on your goals and track every dollar of return.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if my retainer is actually working?',
    answer: 'Every retainer includes monthly reporting with clear KPIs tied to business outcomes — not vanity metrics. You\'ll see traffic growth, lead volume, conversion rates, cost per acquisition, and pipeline attribution. We set benchmarks in month one and track against them. If something isn\'t working, I\'ll tell you directly and adjust the strategy. No hiding behind impressions and click-through rates.',

          What Does a Marketing Retainer Actually Include?
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
          A marketing retainer is a monthly agreement where you pay a fixed fee for ongoing marketing strategy and execution. What's included varies enormously — from bare-minimum reporting to full-service marketing leadership. The key is knowing what to expect at your price point and which inclusions actually move the needle versus pad the deliverables list.

        <h2 class="font-headline text-3xl font-bold text-navy">Why Retainers Exist (and Why They're Usually Better Than Projects)</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          Marketing isn't a one-time activity. It's a system that compounds over time. A blog post you publish in month one earns traffic in month six. A paid media campaign you optimize in week two performs better in week eight. SEO work you do today pays dividends for years.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          One-off projects have their place — audits, strategy sprints, and launch campaigns all work well as standalone engagements. But the real value in marketing comes from sustained, strategic effort. That's what a retainer buys you: continuity, compounding results, and a partner who understands your business deeply enough to make smart decisions fast.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          The problem is that "retainer" has become an industry catch-all that can mean anything from "we'll check in once a month" to "we run your entire marketing department." Let's break down what you should actually expect.
        </p>

        <!-- WHAT'S ALWAYS INCLUDED -->
        <h2 class="font-headline text-3xl font-bold text-navy mt-16">What Should Always Be Included (at Any Price Point)</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          Regardless of what tier or package you buy, any legitimate marketing retainer should include these non-negotiables. If they're missing, ask why.

            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy">Analytics and Tracking Infrastructure</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Proper GA4 setup, conversion tracking, UTM frameworks, and attribution modeling. You can't improve what you can't measure. This should be set up in month one and maintained throughout the engagement.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy">Monthly Reporting with Business Metrics</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Not a PDF of screenshots. Real reporting that connects marketing activity to business outcomes: leads generated, pipeline created, cost per acquisition, and revenue attribution. You should understand exactly what your marketing dollars are producing.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy">Strategic Direction and Prioritization</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Someone should be thinking about which activities to prioritize, what to test next, and how channels connect. If your retainer only includes execution without strategy, you're paying for hands without a brain.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy">Regular Communication</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-muted">At minimum, a monthly strategy call and async access for questions. Bi-weekly calls are better for growth-stage companies. Weekly calls are standard at the fractional CMO level. If you're only hearing from your marketer when the invoice arrives, something is wrong.</p>

              <p class="mt-1 text-muted">You should own all accounts, assets, and data. All ad accounts should be in your name. All content should be yours. If the relationship ends, everything stays with you — no hostage situations.</p>

            <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-muted">If your calls are with an account manager who then relays information to the actual strategist, you're playing telephone with your marketing budget. Insist on direct access to the person doing the thinking.</p>

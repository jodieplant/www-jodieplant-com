    question: 'What exactly does a fractional CMO do day-to-day?',
    answer: 'A fractional CMO operates as your senior marketing leader on a part-time basis — typically 10-20 hours per week. Day-to-day work includes setting strategy, managing campaigns, overseeing content and paid media, running analytics, coordinating with sales, and reporting to leadership. The difference from a consultant is execution: a fractional CMO doesn\'t just advise, they build and run the marketing engine. At Jodie Plant Marketing, that includes AI-enhanced workflows that multiply output beyond what traditional fractional CMOs deliver.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should I work with a fractional CMO before hiring in-house?',
    answer: 'Most startups work with a fractional CMO for 6-18 months. The sweet spot is staying fractional until you hit $5M-$10M ARR or have a clear, repeatable growth engine that justifies a $200K+ full-time hire. A good fractional CMO will actually help you define what that in-house role should look like and assist with hiring when you\'re ready.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a fractional CMO replace a marketing agency entirely?',
    answer: 'In most cases, yes — especially for startups spending under $10K/month on marketing. A fractional CMO with AI-enhanced workflows can handle strategy, content, SEO, paid media, and reporting. Where agencies still make sense is for highly specialized execution like large-scale video production or PR campaigns that require deep media relationships. But for the core growth marketing engine, a fractional CMO is typically more effective and more cost-efficient.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What stage should my startup be at to hire a fractional CMO?',
    answer: 'The ideal stage is post-product-market-fit, typically Series A or late seed with $1M+ ARR. You need enough budget to invest meaningfully in marketing ($3K-$10K/month) and enough business clarity to set real growth targets. Pre-PMF startups usually benefit more from a focused project like a GTM strategy sprint rather than ongoing fractional leadership.',

          For most startups between seed and Series B, a fractional CMO delivers the best combination of senior expertise, cost efficiency, and speed. But the right model depends entirely on your stage, budget, and what you actually need. Here's the honest breakdown.

        <!-- THE AI-ENHANCED FRACTIONAL MODEL -->
        <h2 class="font-headline text-3xl font-bold text-navy mt-16">Why the Fractional Model Has Changed in 2026</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          The traditional knock against fractional CMOs was capacity. One person, even a senior one, can only do so much in 15-20 hours a week. That constraint has fundamentally shifted.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          AI-enhanced workflows now allow a single senior marketer to deliver output that would have required a 3-4 person team just two years ago. Research that took a week takes hours. Content production that required a writer, editor, and SEO specialist can be orchestrated by one strategist with the right AI systems. Campaign optimization that demanded constant manual monitoring runs on intelligent automation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-text leading-relaxed">
          The result: the fractional CMO model now covers more ground, moves faster, and costs less per output than it ever has. For startups between $500K and $10M ARR, it's become the default smart choice.

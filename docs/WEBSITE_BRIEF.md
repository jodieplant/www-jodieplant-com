## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building

A marketing website for Jodie Plant Marketing — a solo, AI/tech-forward digital marketing agency targeting startups and tech companies. The site needs to generate inbound enquiries and showcase expertise to establish credibility. It must practice what it preaches: a marketer's website should itself be a demonstration of marketing craft.

### Phased MVP Approach

| Phase | Timeline | Scope | Goal |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| **MVP** | Week 1-2 | 5 pages, contact form, social proof, analytics | Ship and start generating leads |
| **Phase 2** | Week 3-4 | + Blog (2-3 seed posts), chat widget, lead magnet | Build authority, capture leads |
| **Phase 3** | Month 2+ | + Case studies, service sub-pages, A/B testing | Deepen proof, optimize conversion |

**MVP Scope** (Ship This First):
- Homepage (hero, social proof, services, CTA)
- About page (Jodie's story, approach, AI advantage)
- Services page (AI-led service structure, engagement models)
- Results page (methodology, real credentials, numbers — not fake case studies)
- Contact page (form + email + calendar booking — multiple conversion paths)
- Basic analytics (page views, CTA clicks, form submissions)

**Not in MVP** (Explicitly Deferred):
- Blog (Phase 2 — but infrastructure is Phase 2 priority, not Phase 3)
- Live chat widget (Phase 2)
- Individual case study pages (Phase 3 — need real content)
- Individual service sub-pages (Phase 3)
- Email capture / newsletter (Phase 2)
- CRM integration (Phase 2)
- A/B testing (Phase 3)

### Primary Goals

1. **Communicate value in 10 seconds** — Visitor understands what Jodie does, who it's for, and why she's different
2. **Generate enquiries** — Multiple conversion paths: contact form (lowest friction), email, calendar booking
3. **Demonstrate expertise** — The site itself should demonstrate marketing craft; real credentials over fake case studies
4. **Differentiate** — AI/tech-forward approach, senior-level attention, no agency bloat
5. **Create urgency** — Limited capacity positioning drives action over procrastination

### Tone & Voice

**Bold, confident, direct.** The brand voice is assertive and results-driven — "we get results" energy. Not corporate jargon. Not apologetic. Not trying to sound bigger than we are. Honest, sharp, and to the point.

| Trait | Do | Don't |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Confident** | "We deliver results" | "We try our best" |
| **Direct** | "Here's what we'll do" | "Perhaps we could consider" |
| **Honest** | "One person, full attention" | "Our team of experts" |
| **Technical** | "AI-powered campaign optimization" | "We use computers to help" |
| **Warm** | "Let's talk" | "Submit your enquiry" |
| **Urgent** | "Currently taking 2 new clients" | "Contact us anytime" |

## 2. Strategic Positioning

### Brand Positioning Statement

**For** startup founders, CTOs, and heads of marketing at tech companies who need marketing that actually moves the needle,
**Jodie Plant Marketing is** an AI/tech-forward digital marketing partner
**that** delivers full-service marketing with senior-level attention on every account,
**unlike** big agencies that hand you off to juniors, freelancers who only do one thing, or DIY tools that lack strategy,
**Jodie** combines deep marketing expertise with modern AI tools to deliver faster, smarter, and more measurable results.

### Core Brand Promise

**Results-driven marketing, powered by someone who actually gives a damn.**

### Emotional Benefit

Replace the anxiety of "is our marketing even working?" with confidence and clarity. No more wondering if your agency is paying attention, no more junior account managers learning on your budget, no more fragmented freelancer relationships.

### Functional Benefit

- Full-service marketing from a single, senior practitioner
- AI-enhanced workflows that move faster than traditional agencies
- Direct access to the person doing the work — always
- Data-driven decisions, not gut feelings
- Startup-native — understands the constraints and pace

### Scarcity & Urgency Positioning

Solo practitioners have a natural capacity constraint — this is a feature, not a bug. The site should use this honestly:

- **Capacity signal**: "Currently taking on 2 new clients this quarter" (update quarterly)
- **Availability signal**: "Next available: [Month Year]" (update as needed)
- **Quality signal**: "I limit my client roster to give each company my full attention"

This isn't manufactured urgency — it's the honest reality of a one-person operation. Prospects who delay may genuinely miss out.

## 3. Target Audiences

### Primary: Startup Founders (Seed to Series B)

**Profile**: Technical founders who've built a product but need help getting it in front of the right people. Marketing feels like a foreign language but they know they need it.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Built something great, nobody knows about it. Tried DIY marketing, wasted time. Previous agency burned budget with no results |
| Trigger | Just raised a round, need to show growth. Competitor gaining visibility. Board asking about marketing metrics |
| Win | Clear marketing strategy, measurable pipeline growth, someone who "gets" tech |
| Budget | £2k-10k/month |
| Channels | LinkedIn, startup events, founder communities, referrals |

**Key Messages**:
- "You build the product. I'll build the pipeline."
- "Marketing that understands your tech stack"
- "No hand-off to juniors. Ever."

### Primary: Heads of Marketing at Tech Companies

**Profile**: Solo or small marketing team leads at tech companies (20-200 employees) who need specialist support or overflow capacity. They know marketing but need an extra pair of senior hands.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Too much to do, not enough team. Need specialist skills (SEO, paid ads) without hiring full-time. Agency overhead and communication friction |
| Trigger | Big launch coming, new market entry, team member leaving, scaling pressure |
| Win | Reliable execution partner who doesn't need hand-holding |
| Budget | £3k-15k/month |
| Channels | LinkedIn, marketing communities, industry events, referrals |

**Key Messages**:
- "An extension of your team, not another vendor"
- "Senior marketing execution, on demand"
- "I speak your language — literally"

### Secondary: CTOs / Technical Co-founders

**Profile**: CTOs at startups who've been handed the "and marketing" brief alongside their technical role. They want someone who can speak their language and move at their pace.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Marketing feels like guesswork. Agencies speak a different language. Need data-driven, systematic approach |
| Trigger | CEO told them to "sort out marketing." Need to hire but want to understand it first |
| Win | A marketing partner who thinks like an engineer — systematic, measurable, iterative |
| Budget | £2k-8k/month |
| Channels | Tech meetups, dev communities, LinkedIn, referrals from other founders |

**Key Messages**:
- "Marketing, explained in your language"
- "Data in, decisions out"
- "Think of it as CI/CD for your brand"

## 4. Value Propositions

### Primary Value Proposition

> **Full-service digital marketing for tech companies — powered by AI, delivered by a senior marketer who's actually paying attention.**

### Supporting Value Props

| Differentiator | Benefit | One-liner |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| AI/tech-forward | Faster execution, better insights | "AI-enhanced marketing that moves at startup speed" |
| Senior-level attention | No juniors, no hand-offs | "One senior marketer. Your entire account." |
| Full-service | One partner for everything | "SEO, paid, social, content, email — one relationship" |
| Startup-native | Understands constraints and pace | "Built for companies that move fast and break things" |
| Data-driven | Transparent, measurable results | "Every pound tracked. Every result measured." |
| No bloat | No account managers, no overhead | "You're not paying for a fancy office and a sales team" |

### The "Why Jodie" Argument

1. **AI advantage** — Uses modern AI tools (not just ChatGPT) to research, create, optimize, and analyze faster than traditional agencies
2. **Senior from day one** — 100% of the work is done by someone with real experience, not delegated to graduates
3. **Tech-native** — Genuinely understands how tech companies work, not an agency that "also does tech"
4. **Founder-led** — Jodie's reputation is on the line with every engagement — the incentives are aligned
5. **Full-service without the full-service price** — AI-enhanced workflows mean one person can deliver what used to take a team

### Lead Magnet / Value Exchange

Don't just ask prospects to "get in touch" — offer them something concrete in return:

**MVP Lead Magnet**: "Free Marketing Audit"
- CTA: "Get a free 15-minute marketing audit" or "See what I'd do for your startup"
- Prospect fills out a short form (company URL, biggest challenge, budget range)
- Jodie responds with a brief, personalised assessment + recommended next steps
- This demonstrates expertise before any money changes hands

**Why this works**: It's low commitment for the prospect, showcases Jodie's thinking, and creates a natural segue into a paid engagement. It also pre-qualifies leads — anyone willing to fill out the form is genuinely interested.

**Alternative/supplementary lead magnets** (Phase 2):
- "Startup Marketing Checklist" downloadable PDF
- "Is your marketing working?" self-assessment quiz
- Blog posts demonstrating expertise

---

## 5. Service Offerings

### How to Present Services: AI-Led, Not Generic

The services page must **not** read like every other marketing freelancer's list. The differentiator is HOW these services are delivered — with AI-enhanced workflows. Lead with the method, not just the menu.

**Structure each service as: What AI changes + What you get + Why it matters**

### The AI-Enhanced Approach (Lead With This)

Before listing individual services, establish the overarching method:

> "Every service I deliver is powered by an AI-enhanced workflow. This isn't about replacing strategy with automation — it's about using modern tools to research deeper, create faster, optimise smarter, and report clearer than a traditional agency can."

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

**The AI difference**: AI-powered competitor analysis, content gap identification at scale, and automated technical audit workflows that find issues humans miss.

**What you get**:
- Technical SEO audit and remediation
- Keyword strategy and content mapping
- On-page optimization
- Monthly performance reporting
- Competitor gap analysis

**For the client**: "Get found by the people already searching for what you sell."

**For the client**: "Turn ad spend into pipeline, not vanity metrics."

**What you get**:
- Platform strategy (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, others as relevant)
- Content calendar and creation
- Community engagement
- Social listening and competitor monitoring
- Performance reporting

**For the client**: "Build a brand presence where your audience actually hangs out."

### Content Marketing

**The AI difference**: AI-assisted research and first-draft generation, SEO-optimised content structures, and automated content performance analysis.

**What you get**:
- Content strategy and editorial calendar
- Blog posts and long-form content
- Case studies and customer stories
- Landing page copy
- Content performance tracking

**For the client**: "Content that ranks, converts, and sounds like a human wrote it — because a human refined it."

**The AI difference**: AI-powered subject line optimization, send-time personalisation, and automated segmentation based on engagement patterns.

**What you get**:
- Email strategy and segmentation
- Campaign creation and automation
- List hygiene and growth
- A/B testing and optimization
- Deliverability monitoring

**For the client**: "Nurture leads into customers without being annoying about it."

### Analytics & Reporting

**The AI difference**: AI-generated insight summaries, anomaly detection, and natural-language reporting that explains what the data means — not just what it says.

**What you get**:
- Analytics infrastructure setup (GA4, PostHog, etc.)
- Custom dashboards
- Monthly performance reports
- Attribution modeling
- Actionable recommendations

**For the client**: "Finally know what's working and what's burning money."

## 6. Competitive Differentiation

### Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Model | Weakness |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Big agencies** | Retainer £5k-50k/month | Hand-off to juniors, slow, expensive overhead, generic playbooks |
| **Other freelancers** | Day rate / retainer | Usually single-channel specialists, inconsistent availability, no AI edge |
| **In-house hire** | £40-80k salary + benefits | Expensive, single skill set, recruitment time, management overhead |
| **DIY tools** | £100-500/month in SaaS | Tools without strategy, time-consuming, learning curve, no expertise |

### How Jodie Plant Compares

| Capability | Jodie Plant | Big Agency | Freelancer | In-House |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Senior attention** | 100% of work | Junior does 80% | Varies | One person |
| **Service breadth** | Full-service | Full-service | Usually 1-2 channels | 1-2 channels |
| **AI-enhanced** | Core differentiator | Maybe, slowly | Rarely | Depends |
| **Startup experience** | Native | Afterthought | Varies | Yes |
| **Cost** | Mid-range | Premium | Low-mid | High (loaded) |
| **Speed** | Fast (AI-assisted) | Slow (process) | Variable | Depends |
| **Accountability** | Name on the door | Account manager buffer | Variable | Direct |

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **AI/Tech-Forward** — "Not just using ChatGPT — systematically using AI across research, creation, optimization, and analysis to deliver more, faster"
2. **Senior-Level, Always** — "You'll never be handed off to a junior. The person you talk to is the person doing the work"
3. **Full-Service, One Relationship** — "SEO, paid, social, content, email, analytics — one partner, one strategy, no coordination overhead"
4. **Startup-Native** — "Understands runway pressure, product-market fit, and why your Series A deck matters"
5. **No Bloat** — "No account managers. No project managers. No fancy office. Just results"

## 7. Visual Design & Branding

### Brand Direction

Starting from scratch. The brand should feel **bold, modern, and tech-forward** — reflecting the confidence and directness of the voice. Not corporate. Not cutesy. Not another agency with a gradient logo. And critically: **not generic**. The visual identity must feel as bold as the voice.

### Brand Colors

| Color | Use | Hex | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Dark** | Primary backgrounds, nav, footer, dark sections | `#0F172A` | Deep navy/near-black — authority, depth |
| **Accent** | CTAs, links, hover states, brand mark | `#FF6B35` | Warm orange — bold, energetic, stands out against navy. Unexpected for tech — that's the point |
| **Accent Secondary** | Supporting highlights, data viz, tags | `#6366F1` | Indigo — modern, complements the orange |
| **Light Background** | Page backgrounds, cards | `#FFFFFF` / `#F8FAFC` | Clean, generous whitespace |
| **Text** | Body copy | `#1E293B` | Slate 800 — high contrast, readable |
| **Muted** | Secondary text, captions, borders | `#64748B` | Slate 500 |

**Rationale**: The deep navy provides gravitas and tech credibility. The warm orange (`#FF6B35`) is the key brand differentiator — it's confident, energetic, and immediately distinguishable from the sea of blue/indigo tech sites. It signals "bold" and "different" at a glance. The indigo secondary supports the tech positioning without being the whole personality.

**Contrast check**: Orange on navy and orange on white both pass WCAG AA for large text. Body text (slate-800 on white) exceeds AAA. Verify all combinations during implementation.

### Typography

| Element | Font | Weight | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines | **Cabinet Grotesk** | 700-800 | Geometric, bold, distinctive — carries the brand personality. Sets Jodie apart from every Inter/Satoshi site |
| Body | **Inter** | 400-500 | Clean, highly readable, professional. The reliable workhorse |
| Stats/Callouts | **Space Grotesk** | 500-700 | Geometric, techy — for numbers, metrics, labels, pull quotes |

**Rationale**: Cabinet Grotesk for headlines is the bold move that Inter never was. It has character — geometric but with personality, confident at large sizes. Inter for body text is the right call (readability matters more than personality for paragraphs). Space Grotesk bridges the two for data-forward moments.

**Loading**: Cabinet Grotesk and Space Grotesk via Google Fonts or self-hosted (Fontsource). Inter via system font stack (`Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`) or Fontsource for exact weight control.

### Visual Style

- **Bold and clean** — Generous whitespace, strong typographic hierarchy, confident use of scale. Headlines should be BIG
- **Data-forward** — Stats, numbers, and results should be visually prominent. Use Space Grotesk at large sizes for metrics
- **Minimal imagery** — Avoid stock photography entirely. Use typography, color, layout, and geometric shapes to create visual interest
- **Dark sections** — Strategic use of dark backgrounds (navy `#0F172A`) for emphasis sections (hero, CTAs). Orange accent pops against dark
- **Geometric accents** — Subtle geometric shapes/lines as design elements (nod to tech/precision)
- **Motion** — Subtle scroll-triggered animations: fade-in sections, counting-up stat numbers, hover effects on cards. Nothing distracting. Use `prefers-reduced-motion` to respect accessibility

### Mobile-First Design

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum 44×44px for all interactive elements |
| **CTA visibility** | Primary CTA visible without scrolling on 375px viewport |
| **Navigation** | Hamburger menu on mobile, sticky header |
| **Typography** | Minimum 16px body text on mobile (prevents iOS zoom) |
| **Scroll depth** | Key value prop and CTA in first viewport |
| **Loading** | No layout shift — content loads in place |

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Mobile | < 640px | Single column, stacked |
| Tablet | 640-1024px | 2 columns where appropriate |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Full layout, max-width 1280px container |

## 9. MVP Page Specifications

### Homepage (`/`)

**Purpose**: Communicate who Jodie is, what she does, and why visitors should care — within 10 seconds. Drive visitors to make contact. Every section earns the next scroll.

**Design note**: Condensed from 7 sections to 4-5 high-impact sections. Startup founders are time-poor — don't make them scroll through 7 sections to find the CTA.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero (Above the fold — this is everything)

- **Headline**: Bold, benefit-driven statement in Cabinet Grotesk 800. Large scale. (e.g., "Marketing that moves the needle for tech companies")
- **Subhead**: 1-2 sentences expanding on the value prop — AI-forward, senior-level, full-service
- **Primary CTA**: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact (with audit context)
- **Secondary CTA**: "See How I Work" → /results (text link, lower prominence)
- **Availability signal**: Small text below CTAs — "Currently taking on 2 new clients for Q2 2026"
- **Visual**: Dark navy background. Clean typographic hero. Orange accent on CTA. No stock photos. Subtle geometric pattern or gradient accent

#### 2. Social Proof Bar (Immediately after hero)

This is THE most important trust signal for a services business. It must appear before any other content.

- **Credential stats**: 3-4 large numbers in Space Grotesk — years experience, campaigns delivered, ad spend managed, client retention rate. **These must be real numbers, not placeholders.** If exact numbers aren't available, use honest ranges or provable claims
- **Client logos**: If available, a "Trusted by" logo bar. Even 2-3 logos matter
- **Pull quote**: One strong testimonial or endorsement. If no client testimonial exists yet, use a professional endorsement or LinkedIn recommendation
- **Design**: Light background, stats displayed large and bold with orange accent on key numbers

> **Critical**: Do NOT launch with obviously fake stats or placeholder testimonials. Real but modest numbers ("50+ campaigns delivered") beat impressive but obviously fabricated ones ("10,000+ clients served"). If nothing real is available, use credential-based proof instead: years of experience, certifications, notable employers, specific skills.

#### 3. How I'm Different (The pitch)

Combines the old "Problem" and "Jodie Difference" sections into one focused pitch:

- **Opening line**: Short, punchy acknowledgment of the problem ("Tired of agencies that hand you off to juniors?")
- **Three differentiators** as bold cards/blocks:
  1. **AI-Powered** — "I use AI across every workflow — research, creation, optimization, reporting. You get agency output from a senior practitioner." (Orange icon/accent)
  2. **Senior-Level, Always** — "No juniors. No hand-offs. The person you talk to is the person doing the work." (Orange icon/accent)
  3. **Full-Service** — "SEO, paid, social, content, email, analytics — one relationship, one strategy, no coordination overhead." (Orange icon/accent)
- **CTA**: "See what I'd do for your startup →" linking to /contact

#### 4. Services Overview

- 6 service cards in a responsive grid (2×3 on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Each card: icon + service name + one-line benefit (the "For the client" line from Section 5)
- Each card links to /services (to the relevant section anchor)
- Clean, scannable. Not trying to explain everything here — that's what /services is for
- Brief intro line above the grid: "Full-service marketing. Every channel. One partner."

#### 5. Final CTA (Dark section)

- Dark navy background with orange CTA button — high contrast
- **Headline**: "Ready to see what AI-powered marketing can do for your startup?"
- **CTA**: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact
- **Supporting**: "Or email me directly: jodie@jodieplant.com"
- **Availability**: "Currently accepting new clients for Q2 2026"

---

### About Page (`/about`)

**Purpose**: Build trust and personal connection. Show that "solo" means "senior-level attention" not "under-resourced."

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "One marketer. Full attention. Real results."
- Brief positioning statement

#### 2. Jodie's Story

- Background and experience
- Why she started the agency
- The philosophy: senior talent, AI-enhanced, no bloat
- Authentic voice — this should feel personal, not corporate
- Use placeholder copy that captures the right tone (to be replaced with real bio)

#### 3. The Approach

- How Jodie works with clients — 4 steps:
  1. **Understand** — Your business, your market, your goals
  2. **Strategise** — Data-driven plan, not a generic playbook
  3. **Execute** — AI-enhanced workflows, senior-level delivery
  4. **Measure** — Transparent reporting, continuous optimization
- Visual: numbered steps or timeline treatment
- Emphasis on transparency and accountability

#### 4. The AI Advantage

- How AI tools are used to deliver better results:
  - Research and analysis at scale
  - Content creation and optimization
  - Campaign management and optimization
  - Reporting and insights
- Key message: not replacing human strategy — augmenting it
- This section demonstrates the same AI fluency that clients would benefit from

#### 5. CTA

- "Let's talk about your marketing"
- Links to /contact (form) + jodie@jodieplant.com (email)

---

### Services Page (`/services`)

**Purpose**: Detailed breakdown of what's offered, **led by the AI method that makes it different**, not a generic service menu.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "AI-Powered Marketing for Tech Companies"
- Subhead: "Every service I deliver is enhanced by AI — deeper research, faster execution, smarter optimization. One senior marketer with the output of a team."

#### 2. The AI-Enhanced Method (Lead section — BEFORE individual services)

Before listing services, establish the overarching approach:
- Brief explanation of how AI changes the game for each marketing discipline
- Not a generic AI pitch — specific examples of what AI enables
- This section is what makes the page different from every other freelancer's service list

#### 3. Service Blocks

For each of the 6 services, structured as **AI difference + Deliverables + Client benefit**:

Each block:
- Service name and icon (orange accent)
- "The AI difference" — 1-2 sentences on how AI enhances THIS specific service
- Key deliverables (3-5 bullet points)
- Benefit-driven one-liner

Services in order of differentiation strength:
1. **Content Marketing** — AI difference most visible here
2. **SEO** — AI-powered analysis is highly differentiating
3. **Paid Advertising** — AI optimization is concrete and measurable
4. **Analytics & Reporting** — AI-generated insights are a clear advantage
5. **Social Media** — AI-assisted content and timing
6. **Email Marketing** — AI-powered personalisation

Each block should be visually distinct and scannable. Alternating layout (left/right or card-based) to prevent monotony.

#### 4. How Engagements Work

- **Monthly Retainer**: "Ongoing marketing partner — strategy, execution, and optimization on a rolling basis. Most clients start here."
- **Project-Based**: "Defined scope, clear deliverables, fixed timeline. Good for audits, launches, or specific campaigns."
- **Advisory**: "Strategy and guidance without execution. For teams who need direction, not hands."
- What a typical month looks like
- Reporting and communication cadence

#### 5. CTA

- "Not sure what you need? Let's figure it out together."
- "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact
- jodie@jodieplant.com

---

### Results Page (`/results`) — formerly "Work"

**Purpose**: Demonstrate expertise and credibility through **real credentials and honest proof** — not fake case studies with made-up metrics.

> **Why this changed**: Launching with obviously placeholder case studies ("SaaS Startup" with fabricated metrics) undermines credibility. A prospect will see through it instantly. Better to show real credentials honestly than to fabricate proof. The page structure supports adding real case studies later.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "What You Can Expect"
- Subhead: "I don't have a portfolio of logos to hide behind. Here's what I bring instead — real experience, a proven approach, and the results to back it up."

#### 2. Credentials & Numbers

Real, provable stats displayed in Space Grotesk at large scale:
- Years of marketing experience
- Number of campaigns/projects delivered
- Total ad spend managed (if impressive)
- Client retention rate (if available)
- Industry experience ("Worked with companies from seed to Series C")

**These numbers must be real.** Small but honest beats large but fabricated. "8 years in marketing" is more credible than "500+ campaigns delivered" if the latter isn't true.

#### 3. The Approach in Action

Instead of fake case studies, show the methodology applied to real scenarios:
- "Here's what a typical SEO engagement looks like" — month-by-month breakdown
- "How I'd approach a startup launch campaign" — step-by-step
- "What a monthly retainer actually delivers" — concrete deliverable list

This demonstrates expertise without fabricating results. It also answers the question "what do I actually get?"

#### 4. What Clients Say

- Real testimonials or LinkedIn recommendations (even 1-2 is better than none)
- If no client testimonials exist: professional endorsements, colleague recommendations, or specific results from past roles (with appropriate framing: "In my previous role at [Company], I...")
- Structure ready for adding real client testimonials as they come in

#### 5. Industries & Experience

- Types of companies Jodie has worked with or targets
- Relevant industry knowledge (SaaS, fintech, dev tools, etc.)
- Shows pattern recognition — "I've seen what works for companies like yours"

#### 6. CTA

- "Want to see what I'd do for your company?"
- "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact

---

### Contact Page (`/contact`)

**Purpose**: Make it dead simple to get in touch. **Multiple conversion paths** for different comfort levels — not everyone wants to compose an email from scratch.

> **Why this changed**: A mailto: link is high friction — it requires context-switching to an email client, composing from scratch, and hoping the device has email configured. A short form that SENDS to email gives Jodie the same outcome with far less visitor friction. Offering form + email + calendar covers every prospect preference.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "Let's Talk"
- Subhead: "Whether you want a free audit, have a quick question, or are ready to get started — I'm here."

#### 2. Free Marketing Audit CTA (Primary conversion path)

This is the lead magnet in action:
- **Headline**: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit"
- **Description**: "Tell me a bit about your company and I'll send you a personalised assessment of your marketing — what's working, what's not, and where I'd focus first."
- **Short form** with fields:
  - Your name
  - Company name
  - Company URL
  - Biggest marketing challenge (dropdown or short text)
  - Budget range (optional dropdown: <£2k, £2-5k, £5-10k, £10k+)
- Form submits to Jodie's email (via Formspree, Formspark, or similar static-compatible service)
- Confirmation message: "Thanks! I'll review your marketing and get back to you within 24 hours."

#### 3. Other Ways to Reach Me

For prospects who prefer alternatives to the form:

- **Email**: jodie@jodieplant.com — "Prefer email? Drop me a message about what you're working on."
- **Book a call**: Cal.com or Calendly link — "Want to talk it through? Book a 15-minute intro call." (Phase 2 — placeholder link for now)
- **LinkedIn**: Profile link — "Connect with me on LinkedIn"

#### 4. What to Expect

- "I respond to every enquiry within 24 hours"
- "Audit responses include a personalised assessment, not a generic template"
- "No pressure, no hard sell — just an honest conversation about whether I can help"

#### 5. Availability

- "Currently taking on 2 new clients for Q2 2026"
- Creates urgency without being pushy

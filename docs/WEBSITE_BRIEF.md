## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building

A marketing website for Jodie Plant Marketing — a solo, AI/tech-forward digital marketing agency targeting startups and tech companies. The site needs to generate inbound enquiries and showcase expertise to establish credibility. It must practice what it preaches: a marketer's website should itself be a demonstration of marketing craft.

### Phased MVP Approach

| Phase | Timeline | Scope | Goal |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| **MVP** | Week 1-2 | 5 pages, contact form, social proof, analytics | Ship and start generating leads |
| **Phase 2** | Week 3-4 | + Blog (2-3 seed posts), chat widget, lead magnet | Build authority, capture leads |
| **Phase 3** | Month 2+ | + Case studies, service sub-pages, A/B testing | Deepen proof, optimize conversion |

**MVP Scope** (Ship This First):
- Homepage (hero, social proof, services, CTA)
- About page (Jodie's story, approach, AI advantage)
- Services page (AI-led service structure, engagement models)
- Results page (methodology, real credentials, numbers — not fake case studies)
- Contact page (form + email + calendar booking — multiple conversion paths)
- Basic analytics (page views, CTA clicks, form submissions)

**Not in MVP** (Explicitly Deferred):
- Blog (Phase 2 — but infrastructure is Phase 2 priority, not Phase 3)
- Live chat widget (Phase 2)
- Individual case study pages (Phase 3 — need real content)
- Individual service sub-pages (Phase 3)
- Email capture / newsletter (Phase 2)
- CRM integration (Phase 2)
- A/B testing (Phase 3)

### Primary Goals

1. **Communicate value in 10 seconds** — Visitor understands what Jodie does, who it's for, and why she's different
2. **Generate enquiries** — Multiple conversion paths: contact form (lowest friction), email, calendar booking
3. **Demonstrate expertise** — The site itself should demonstrate marketing craft; real credentials over fake case studies
4. **Differentiate** — AI/tech-forward approach, senior-level attention, no agency bloat
5. **Create urgency** — Limited capacity positioning drives action over procrastination

### Tone & Voice

**Bold, confident, direct.** The brand voice is assertive and results-driven — "we get results" energy. Not corporate jargon. Not apologetic. Not trying to sound bigger than we are. Honest, sharp, and to the point.

| Trait | Do | Don't |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Confident** | "We deliver results" | "We try our best" |
| **Direct** | "Here's what we'll do" | "Perhaps we could consider" |
| **Honest** | "One person, full attention" | "Our team of experts" |
| **Technical** | "AI-powered campaign optimization" | "We use computers to help" |
| **Warm** | "Let's talk" | "Submit your enquiry" |
| **Urgent** | "Currently taking 2 new clients" | "Contact us anytime" |

## 2. Strategic Positioning

### Brand Positioning Statement

**For** startup founders, CTOs, and heads of marketing at tech companies who need marketing that actually moves the needle,
**Jodie Plant Marketing is** an AI/tech-forward digital marketing partner
**that** delivers full-service marketing with senior-level attention on every account,
**unlike** big agencies that hand you off to juniors, freelancers who only do one thing, or DIY tools that lack strategy,
**Jodie** combines deep marketing expertise with modern AI tools to deliver faster, smarter, and more measurable results.

### Core Brand Promise

**Results-driven marketing, powered by someone who actually gives a damn.**

### Emotional Benefit

Replace the anxiety of "is our marketing even working?" with confidence and clarity. No more wondering if your agency is paying attention, no more junior account managers learning on your budget, no more fragmented freelancer relationships.

### Functional Benefit

- Full-service marketing from a single, senior practitioner
- AI-enhanced workflows that move faster than traditional agencies
- Direct access to the person doing the work — always
- Data-driven decisions, not gut feelings
- Startup-native — understands the constraints and pace

### Scarcity & Urgency Positioning

Solo practitioners have a natural capacity constraint — this is a feature, not a bug. The site should use this honestly:

- **Capacity signal**: "Currently taking on 2 new clients this quarter" (update quarterly)
- **Availability signal**: "Next available: [Month Year]" (update as needed)
- **Quality signal**: "I limit my client roster to give each company my full attention"

This isn't manufactured urgency — it's the honest reality of a one-person operation. Prospects who delay may genuinely miss out.

## 3. Target Audiences

### Primary: Startup Founders (Seed to Series B)

**Profile**: Technical founders who've built a product but need help getting it in front of the right people. Marketing feels like a foreign language but they know they need it.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Built something great, nobody knows about it. Tried DIY marketing, wasted time. Previous agency burned budget with no results |
| Trigger | Just raised a round, need to show growth. Competitor gaining visibility. Board asking about marketing metrics |
| Win | Clear marketing strategy, measurable pipeline growth, someone who "gets" tech |
| Budget | $2.5k-12k/month |
| Channels | LinkedIn, startup events, founder communities, referrals |

**Key Messages**:
- "You build the product. I'll build the pipeline."
- "Marketing that understands your tech stack"
- "No hand-off to juniors. Ever."

### Primary: Heads of Marketing at Tech Companies

**Profile**: Solo or small marketing team leads at tech companies (20-200 employees) who need specialist support or overflow capacity. They know marketing but need an extra pair of senior hands.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Too much to do, not enough team. Need specialist skills (SEO, paid ads) without hiring full-time. Agency overhead and communication friction |
| Trigger | Big launch coming, new market entry, team member leaving, scaling pressure |
| Win | Reliable execution partner who doesn't need hand-holding |
| Budget | $4k-18k/month |
| Channels | LinkedIn, marketing communities, industry events, referrals |

**Key Messages**:
- "An extension of your team, not another vendor"
- "Senior marketing execution, on demand"
- "I speak your language — literally"

### Secondary: CTOs / Technical Co-founders

**Profile**: CTOs at startups who've been handed the "and marketing" brief alongside their technical role. They want someone who can speak their language and move at their pace.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain | Marketing feels like guesswork. Agencies speak a different language. Need data-driven, systematic approach |
| Trigger | CEO told them to "sort out marketing." Need to hire but want to understand it first |
| Win | A marketing partner who thinks like an engineer — systematic, measurable, iterative |
| Budget | $2.5k-10k/month |
| Channels | Tech meetups, dev communities, LinkedIn, referrals from other founders |

**Key Messages**:
- "Marketing, explained in your language"
- "Data in, decisions out"
- "Think of it as CI/CD for your brand"

## 4. Value Propositions

### Primary Value Proposition

> **Full-service digital marketing for tech companies — powered by AI, delivered by a senior marketer who's actually paying attention.**

### Supporting Value Props

| Differentiator | Benefit | One-liner |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| AI/tech-forward | Faster execution, better insights | "AI-enhanced marketing that moves at startup speed" |
| Senior-level attention | No juniors, no hand-offs | "One senior marketer. Your entire account." |
| Full-service | One partner for everything | "SEO, paid, social, content, email — one relationship" |
| Startup-native | Understands constraints and pace | "Built for companies that move fast and break things" |
| Data-driven | Transparent, measurable results | "Every dollar tracked. Every result measured." |
| No bloat | No account managers, no overhead | "You're not paying for a fancy office and a sales team" |

### The "Why Jodie" Argument

1. **AI advantage** — Uses modern AI tools (not just ChatGPT) to research, create, optimize, and analyze faster than traditional agencies
2. **Senior from day one** — 100% of the work is done by someone with real experience, not delegated to graduates
3. **Tech-native** — Genuinely understands how tech companies work, not an agency that "also does tech"
4. **Founder-led** — Jodie's reputation is on the line with every engagement — the incentives are aligned
5. **Full-service without the full-service price** — AI-enhanced workflows mean one person can deliver what used to take a team

### Lead Magnet / Value Exchange

Don't just ask prospects to "get in touch" — offer them something concrete in return:

**MVP Lead Magnet**: "Free Marketing Audit"
- CTA: "Get a free 15-minute marketing audit" or "See what I'd do for your startup"
- Prospect fills out a short form (company URL, biggest challenge, budget range)
- Jodie responds with a brief, personalised assessment + recommended next steps
- This demonstrates expertise before any money changes hands

**Why this works**: It's low commitment for the prospect, showcases Jodie's thinking, and creates a natural segue into a paid engagement. It also pre-qualifies leads — anyone willing to fill out the form is genuinely interested.

**Alternative/supplementary lead magnets** (Phase 2):
- "Startup Marketing Checklist" downloadable PDF
- "Is your marketing working?" self-assessment quiz
- Blog posts demonstrating expertise

## 5. Service Offerings

### How to Present Services: AI-Led, Not Generic

The services page must **not** read like every other marketing freelancer's list. The differentiator is HOW these services are delivered — with AI-enhanced workflows. Lead with the method, not just the menu.

**Structure each service as: What AI changes + What you get + Why it matters**

### The AI-Enhanced Approach (Lead With This)

Before listing individual services, establish the overarching method:

> "Every service I deliver is powered by an AI-enhanced workflow. This isn't about replacing strategy with automation — it's about using modern tools to research deeper, create faster, optimise smarter, and report clearer than a traditional agency can."

### SEO & GEO (Search + AI Engine Optimization)

**The AI difference**: AI-powered competitor analysis, content gap identification at scale, automated technical audit workflows, and GEO optimization for AI answer engines (see `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md`).

**What you get**:
- Technical SEO audit and remediation
- Keyword strategy and content mapping
- On-page optimization
- GEO/AEO strategy — "best answer" page optimization for AI citations
- Structured data, llms.txt, and AI-crawlability improvements
- Monthly performance reporting (rankings + branded search + AI citation tracking)
- Competitor gap analysis

**For the client**: "Get found by the people — and the AI — already searching for what you sell."

### Paid Advertising (Beyond Google & Meta)

> Google and Meta CPCs keep climbing. For SMBs with budgets under $5K/month, there are stronger plays: Bing (~60% lower CPC), Reddit (~$0.20 CPC), Quora ($0.35–$0.75), Pinterest, TikTok Spark Ads. See `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md` Part 3 for full platform comparison.

**The AI difference**: AI-assisted ad copy generation and testing, predictive bid optimization, automated performance anomaly detection, and smart budget allocation across platforms.

**What you get**:
- Campaign strategy and structure (Google, Meta, AND lower-cost alternatives)
- Platform selection based on budget and audience (not defaulting to Google)
- Ad creative and copywriting
- Audience targeting and segmentation
- Bid management and optimization
- ROAS and conversion tracking across channels

**For the client**: "Turn ad spend into pipeline — on the platforms where your budget actually works."

### Social Media Marketing & Short-Form Video

> Social media (68%) is the #1 channel SMBs say will drive the most business in 2026. Short-form video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts) continues to dominate engagement. See `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md`.

**The AI difference**: AI-driven content ideation, optimal posting time analysis, sentiment monitoring across channels, and AI-assisted short-form video scripting and editing.

**What you get**:
- Platform strategy (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, Instagram, others as relevant)
- Content calendar and creation
- Short-form video content (talking-head, B-roll with text overlays)
- Community engagement
- Social listening and competitor monitoring
- Performance reporting

**For the client**: "Build a brand presence where your audience actually hangs out — with the content formats they actually watch."

### Content Marketing

**The AI difference**: AI-assisted research and first-draft generation, "best answer" content structures optimized for both search and AI citation, and automated content performance analysis.

**What you get**:
- Content strategy and editorial calendar
- "Best answer" pages: pricing, comparisons, alternatives, how-it-works, FAQs
- Blog posts and long-form content
- Case studies, benchmarks, and "how we do it" proof assets
- Landing page copy
- Content distribution plan (LinkedIn, newsletters, partners)
- Content performance tracking

**For the client**: "Content that ranks, gets cited by AI, converts — and sounds like a human wrote it."

### Email Marketing & Owned Audience

**The AI difference**: AI-powered subject line optimization, send-time personalisation, automated segmentation, and smart engagement-based nurture triggers.

**What you get**:
- Email strategy and segmentation
- Campaign creation and automation
- Newsletter setup + lead magnets that are genuinely useful
- Nurture sequences (welcome, education, "book a call")
- Referral loop design (customer referral, partner referral)
- List hygiene and growth
- A/B testing and optimization

**For the client**: "Build an audience you own, nurture them into customers — without being annoying about it."

### Analytics & Reporting

**The AI difference**: AI-generated insight summaries, anomaly detection, and natural-language reporting that explains what the data means — not just what it says.

**What you get**:
- Analytics infrastructure setup (GA4, PostHog, etc.)
- Custom dashboards
- Monthly performance reports
- Attribution modeling
- Actionable recommendations

**For the client**: "Finally know what's working and what's burning money."

### AI Implementation & Workflow Consulting

> 54% of SMBs already use AI marketing tools, but most don't know how to use them strategically. The gap is guidance, not tools. See `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md` Part 1.

**The AI difference**: This IS the AI difference — made into a standalone service. Jodie's own AI-enhanced workflow, systematized and taught to client teams.

**What you get**:
- Audit current marketing processes for AI opportunities
- Recommend & set up AI tools (content creation, analytics, automation)
- Train team on effective AI usage
- Build SOPs for AI-assisted marketing workflows
- Ongoing advisory on new tools and techniques

**For the client**: "Do more with less. We'll show you exactly how AI fits into your marketing — no hype, just practical efficiency gains."

### Local Visibility & Reputation (SMB Services)

**The AI difference**: AI-powered review sentiment analysis, automated review prompt workflows, and competitive local ranking analysis at scale.

**What you get**:
- Google Business Profile optimization
- Review generation system (email/SMS prompts, routing)
- Local pages and service area pages
- Citation cleanup and NAP consistency
- Local competitor analysis

**For the client**: "Turn your Google profile into your best sales rep — calls, directions, bookings on autopilot."

### Service Packaging (Market-Aligned)

> Based on 2026 market research (see `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md`): buyers want measurable leads, less platform dependence, and credibility in both AI and human discovery. Present services as tiered packages — simple, clear, easy to choose.

#### Retainer Packages

| Package | Monthly Fee | What's Included | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Foundation** | $1,500–$2,500 | Social media (2 platforms, including short-form video), content creation (8–12 posts), basic email marketing (2–4 campaigns), local visibility setup, monthly reporting | Local businesses, early-stage startups |
| **Growth** | $2,500–$4,500 | Foundation + GEO/SEO strategy, "best answer" content pages, one paid ad channel, AI visibility monitoring, partnership channel activation | Growing SMBs, funded startups |
| **Authority** | $4,500–$7,500 | Growth + full GEO + SEO, multi-channel paid media, email automation & nurture sequences, AI workflow consulting, schema markup & technical optimization | Established SMBs ready to dominate their niche |

#### One-Time Projects

| Project | Fee Range |
|---------|-----------|
| AI Visibility Audit | $500–$1,500 |
| Conversion & Tracking Setup | $1,000–$3,000 |
| Marketing Strategy & Roadmap | $1,500–$3,000 |
| Email Automation Setup | $1,000–$2,500 |
| Website Content Overhaul for GEO | $2,000–$5,000 |

#### Budget Alignment

| Monthly Budget | Buyer Profile | Recommended Package |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| $1,500–$2,500 | Local businesses, early-stage startups | Foundation |

| $5,000–$7,500 | Established SMBs | Authority |
| $7,500+ | Growth-stage companies | Custom engagement |

> **Pricing note:** Frame everything around outcomes, not deliverables. Not "12 posts per month" but "build your brand's AI citation presence and drive qualified leads." Charge for value from day one.

## 6. Competitive Differentiation

### Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Model | Weakness |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Big agencies** | Retainer $6k-60k/month | Hand-off to juniors, slow, expensive overhead, generic playbooks |
| **Other freelancers** | Day rate / retainer | Usually single-channel specialists, inconsistent availability, no AI edge |
| **In-house hire** | $50-100k salary + benefits | Expensive, single skill set, recruitment time, management overhead |
| **DIY tools** | $100-500/month in SaaS | Tools without strategy, time-consuming, learning curve, no expertise |

### How Jodie Plant Compares

| Capability | Jodie Plant | Big Agency | Freelancer | In-House |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Senior attention** | 100% of work | Junior does 80% | Varies | One person |
| **Service breadth** | Full-service | Full-service | Usually 1-2 channels | 1-2 channels |
| **AI-enhanced** | Core differentiator | Maybe, slowly | Rarely | Depends |
| **Startup experience** | Native | Afterthought | Varies | Yes |
| **Cost** | Mid-range | Premium | Low-mid | High (loaded) |
| **Speed** | Fast (AI-assisted) | Slow (process) | Variable | Depends |
| **Accountability** | Name on the door | Account manager buffer | Variable | Direct |

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **AI-Forward (Method + Services)** — "I use AI to deliver faster AND I get your brand cited by AI. Most agencies are still selling 2020 SEO — I sell 2026 visibility." (This combines two edges: AI as a delivery method AND GEO/AEO as a service offering. Both are genuinely differentiating.)
2. **Senior-Level, Always** — "You'll never be handed off to a junior. The person you talk to is the person doing the work"
3. **Full-Service, One Relationship** — "SEO, paid, social, content, email, analytics — one partner, one strategy, no coordination overhead"
4. **Startup-Native** — "Understands runway pressure, product-market fit, and why your Series A deck matters"
5. **No Bloat** — "No account managers. No project managers. No fancy office. Just results"

### Vertical Specialization Strategy

> Consider highlighting 1–2 target verticals on the site to build credibility faster. See `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md` Part 5.

**Strongest fits for Jodie:**
- **Tech/SaaS startups** — already the primary target audience, natural alignment
- **Local service businesses** — high demand for local SEO + reviews, clear ROI, fast results

**Why specialize:** Deep case studies in a vertical build trust faster than being a generalist. "I've done this for 5 other SaaS companies" beats "I can do it for anyone." Can expand verticals later once proof points exist.

**How to implement:** Not a hard pivot — more like featured case studies, industry-specific language on service pages, and "Industries" section on Results page that highlights depth in chosen verticals.

---

## 7. Visual Design & Branding

### Brand Direction

Starting from scratch. The brand should feel **bold, modern, and tech-forward** — reflecting the confidence and directness of the voice. Not corporate. Not cutesy. Not another agency with a gradient logo. And critically: **not generic**. The visual identity must feel as bold as the voice.

### Brand Colors

| Color | Use | Hex | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Dark** | Primary backgrounds, nav, footer, dark sections | `#0F172A` | Deep navy/near-black — authority, depth |
| **Accent** | CTAs, links, hover states, brand mark | `#FF6B35` | Warm orange — bold, energetic, stands out against navy. Unexpected for tech — that's the point |
| **Accent Secondary** | Supporting highlights, data viz, tags | `#6366F1` | Indigo — modern, complements the orange |
| **Light Background** | Page backgrounds, cards | `#FFFFFF` / `#F8FAFC` | Clean, generous whitespace |
| **Text** | Body copy | `#1E293B` | Slate 800 — high contrast, readable |
| **Muted** | Secondary text, captions, borders | `#64748B` | Slate 500 |

**Rationale**: The deep navy provides gravitas and tech credibility. The warm orange (`#FF6B35`) is the key brand differentiator — it's confident, energetic, and immediately distinguishable from the sea of blue/indigo tech sites. It signals "bold" and "different" at a glance. The indigo secondary supports the tech positioning without being the whole personality.

**Contrast check**: Orange on navy and orange on white both pass WCAG AA for large text. Body text (slate-800 on white) exceeds AAA. Verify all combinations during implementation.

### Typography

| Element | Font | Weight | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines | **Cabinet Grotesk** | 700-800 | Geometric, bold, distinctive — carries the brand personality. Sets Jodie apart from every Inter/Satoshi site |
| Body | **Inter** | 400-500 | Clean, highly readable, professional. The reliable workhorse |
| Stats/Callouts | **Space Grotesk** | 500-700 | Geometric, techy — for numbers, metrics, labels, pull quotes |

**Rationale**: Cabinet Grotesk for headlines is the bold move that Inter never was. It has character — geometric but with personality, confident at large sizes. Inter for body text is the right call (readability matters more than personality for paragraphs). Space Grotesk bridges the two for data-forward moments.

**Loading**: Cabinet Grotesk and Space Grotesk via Google Fonts or self-hosted (Fontsource). Inter via system font stack (`Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`) or Fontsource for exact weight control.

### Visual Style

- **Bold and clean** — Generous whitespace, strong typographic hierarchy, confident use of scale. Headlines should be BIG
- **Data-forward** — Stats, numbers, and results should be visually prominent. Use Space Grotesk at large sizes for metrics
- **Minimal imagery** — Avoid stock photography entirely. Use typography, color, layout, and geometric shapes to create visual interest
- **Dark sections** — Strategic use of dark backgrounds (navy `#0F172A`) for emphasis sections (hero, CTAs). Orange accent pops against dark
- **Geometric accents** — Subtle geometric shapes/lines as design elements (nod to tech/precision)
- **Motion** — Subtle scroll-triggered animations: fade-in sections, counting-up stat numbers, hover effects on cards. Nothing distracting. Use `prefers-reduced-motion` to respect accessibility

### Mobile-First Design

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum 44×44px for all interactive elements |
| **CTA visibility** | Primary CTA visible without scrolling on 375px viewport |
| **Navigation** | Hamburger menu on mobile, sticky header |
| **Typography** | Minimum 16px body text on mobile (prevents iOS zoom) |
| **Scroll depth** | Key value prop and CTA in first viewport |
| **Loading** | No layout shift — content loads in place |

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Mobile | < 640px | Single column, stacked |
| Tablet | 640-1024px | 2 columns where appropriate |
| Desktop | > 1024px | Full layout, max-width 1280px container |

## 9. MVP Page Specifications

### Homepage (`/`)

**Purpose**: Communicate who Jodie is, what she does, and why visitors should care — within 10 seconds. Drive visitors to make contact. Every section earns the next scroll.

**Design note**: Condensed from 7 sections to 4-5 high-impact sections. Startup founders are time-poor — don't make them scroll through 7 sections to find the CTA.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero (Above the fold — this is everything)

- **Headline**: Bold, benefit-driven statement in Cabinet Grotesk 800. Large scale. (e.g., "Marketing that moves the needle for tech companies")
- **Subhead**: 1-2 sentences expanding on the value prop — AI-forward, senior-level, full-service
- **Primary CTA**: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact (with audit context)
- **Secondary CTA**: "See How I Work" → /results (text link, lower prominence)
- **Availability signal**: Small text below CTAs — "Currently taking on 2 new clients for Q2 2026"
- **Visual**: Dark navy background. Clean typographic hero. Orange accent on CTA. No stock photos. Subtle geometric pattern or gradient accent

#### 2. Social Proof Bar (Immediately after hero)

This is THE most important trust signal for a services business. It must appear before any other content.

- **Credential stats**: 3-4 large numbers in Space Grotesk — years experience, campaigns delivered, ad spend managed, client retention rate. **These must be real numbers, not placeholders.** If exact numbers aren't available, use honest ranges or provable claims
- **Client logos**: If available, a "Trusted by" logo bar. Even 2-3 logos matter
- **Pull quote**: One strong testimonial or endorsement. If no client testimonial exists yet, use a professional endorsement or LinkedIn recommendation
- **Design**: Light background, stats displayed large and bold with orange accent on key numbers

> **Critical**: Do NOT launch with obviously fake stats or placeholder testimonials. Real but modest numbers ("50+ campaigns delivered") beat impressive but obviously fabricated ones ("10,000+ clients served"). If nothing real is available, use credential-based proof instead: years of experience, certifications, notable employers, specific skills.

#### 3. How I'm Different (The pitch)

Combines the old "Problem" and "Jodie Difference" sections into one focused pitch:

- **Opening line**: Short, punchy acknowledgment of the problem ("Tired of agencies that hand you off to juniors?")
- **Three differentiators** as bold cards/blocks:
  1. **AI-Powered** — "I use AI across every workflow — research, creation, optimization, reporting. You get agency output from a senior practitioner." (Orange icon/accent)
  2. **Senior-Level, Always** — "No juniors. No hand-offs. The person you talk to is the person doing the work." (Orange icon/accent)
  3. **Full-Service** — "SEO, paid, social, content, email, analytics — one relationship, one strategy, no coordination overhead." (Orange icon/accent)
- **CTA**: "See what I'd do for your startup →" linking to /contact

#### 4. Services Overview

- Each card links to /services (to the relevant section anchor)

### About Page (`/about`)

**Purpose**: Build trust and personal connection. Show that "solo" means "senior-level attention" not "under-resourced."

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "One marketer. Full attention. Real results."
- Brief positioning statement

#### 2. Jodie's Story

- Background and experience
- Why she started the agency
- The philosophy: senior talent, AI-enhanced, no bloat
- Authentic voice — this should feel personal, not corporate
- Use placeholder copy that captures the right tone (to be replaced with real bio)

#### 3. The Approach

- How Jodie works with clients — 4 steps:
  1. **Understand** — Your business, your market, your goals
  2. **Strategise** — Data-driven plan, not a generic playbook
  3. **Execute** — AI-enhanced workflows, senior-level delivery
  4. **Measure** — Transparent reporting, continuous optimization
- Visual: numbered steps or timeline treatment
- Emphasis on transparency and accountability

#### 4. The AI Advantage

- How AI tools are used to deliver better results:
  - Research and analysis at scale
  - Content creation and optimization
  - Campaign management and optimization
  - Reporting and insights
- Key message: not replacing human strategy — augmenting it
- This section demonstrates the same AI fluency that clients would benefit from

#### 5. CTA

- "Let's talk about your marketing"
- Links to /contact (form) + jodie@jodieplant.com (email)

---

### Services Page (`/services`)

**Purpose**: Detailed breakdown of what's offered, **led by the AI method that makes it different**, not a generic service menu.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "AI-Powered Marketing for Tech Companies"
- Subhead: "Every service I deliver is enhanced by AI — deeper research, faster execution, smarter optimization. One senior marketer with the output of a team."

#### 2. The AI-Enhanced Method (Lead section — BEFORE individual services)

Before listing services, establish the overarching approach:
- Brief explanation of how AI changes the game for each marketing discipline
- Not a generic AI pitch — specific examples of what AI enables
- This section is what makes the page different from every other freelancer's service list

#### 3. Service Blocks

For each of the 8 services, structured as **AI difference + Deliverables + Client benefit**:

Each block:
- Service name and icon (orange accent)
- "The AI difference" — 1-2 sentences on how AI enhances THIS specific service
- Key deliverables (3-5 bullet points)
- Benefit-driven one-liner

Services in order of differentiation strength:
1. **SEO & GEO** — GEO positioning is the single most differentiating offering in 2026
2. **AI Implementation & Workflow Consulting** — unique to AI-forward agencies
3. **Content Marketing** — "best answer" approach is differentiating
4. **Paid Advertising (Beyond Google & Meta)** — "beyond" framing is differentiating
5. **Social Media & Short-Form Video** — video emphasis signals current-market awareness
6. **Local Visibility & Reputation** — high demand, clear ROI for SMBs
7. **Email Marketing & Owned Audience** — audience ownership reduces platform dependence
8. **Analytics & Reporting** — foundational, enables everything else

Each block should be visually distinct and scannable. Alternating layout (left/right or card-based) to prevent monotony.

#### 4. Packages & Pricing

Show the three tiered retainer packages (Foundation / Growth / Authority) from Section 5, plus one-time projects. Design as pricing cards with orange accent on recommended tier (Growth). Each card shows: what's included, who it's for, price range, CTA to /contact.

- What a typical month looks like at each tier
- Reporting and communication cadence

#### 5. CTA

- "Not sure what you need? Let's figure it out together."
- "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact
- jodie@jodieplant.com

---

### Results Page (`/results`) — formerly "Work"

**Purpose**: Demonstrate expertise and credibility through **real credentials and honest proof** — not fake case studies with made-up metrics.

> **Why this changed**: Launching with obviously placeholder case studies ("SaaS Startup" with fabricated metrics) undermines credibility. A prospect will see through it instantly. Better to show real credentials honestly than to fabricate proof. The page structure supports adding real case studies later.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "What You Can Expect"
- Subhead: "I don't have a portfolio of logos to hide behind. Here's what I bring instead — real experience, a proven approach, and the results to back it up."

#### 2. Credentials & Numbers

Real, provable stats displayed in Space Grotesk at large scale:
- Years of marketing experience
- Number of campaigns/projects delivered
- Total ad spend managed (if impressive)
- Client retention rate (if available)
- Industry experience ("Worked with companies from seed to Series C")

**These numbers must be real.** Small but honest beats large but fabricated. "8 years in marketing" is more credible than "500+ campaigns delivered" if the latter isn't true.

#### 3. The Approach in Action

Instead of fake case studies, show the methodology applied to real scenarios:
- "Here's what a typical SEO engagement looks like" — month-by-month breakdown
- "How I'd approach a startup launch campaign" — step-by-step
- "What a monthly retainer actually delivers" — concrete deliverable list

This demonstrates expertise without fabricating results. It also answers the question "what do I actually get?"

#### 4. What Clients Say

- Real testimonials or LinkedIn recommendations (even 1-2 is better than none)
- If no client testimonials exist: professional endorsements, colleague recommendations, or specific results from past roles (with appropriate framing: "In my previous role at [Company], I...")
- Structure ready for adding real client testimonials as they come in

#### 5. Industries & Experience

- Types of companies Jodie has worked with or targets
- Relevant industry knowledge (SaaS, fintech, dev tools, etc.)
- Shows pattern recognition — "I've seen what works for companies like yours"

#### 6. CTA

- "Want to see what I'd do for your company?"
- "Get Your Free Marketing Audit" → /contact

---

### Contact Page (`/contact`)

**Purpose**: Make it dead simple to get in touch. **Multiple conversion paths** for different comfort levels — not everyone wants to compose an email from scratch.

> **Why this changed**: A mailto: link is high friction — it requires context-switching to an email client, composing from scratch, and hoping the device has email configured. A short form that SENDS to email gives Jodie the same outcome with far less visitor friction. Offering form + email + calendar covers every prospect preference.

**Sections**:

#### 1. Hero

- Headline in Cabinet Grotesk: "Let's Talk"
- Subhead: "Whether you want a free audit, have a quick question, or are ready to get started — I'm here."

#### 2. Free Marketing Audit CTA (Primary conversion path)

This is the lead magnet in action:
- **Headline**: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit"
- **Description**: "Tell me a bit about your company and I'll send you a personalised assessment of your marketing — what's working, what's not, and where I'd focus first."
- **Short form** with fields:
  - Your name
  - Company name
  - Company URL
  - Biggest marketing challenge (dropdown or short text)
  - Budget range (optional dropdown: <$2k, $2-5k, $5-10k, $10k+)
- Form submits to Jodie's email (via Formspree, Formspark, or similar static-compatible service)
- Confirmation message: "Thanks! I'll review your marketing and get back to you within 24 hours."

#### 3. Other Ways to Reach Me

For prospects who prefer alternatives to the form:

- **Email**: jodie@jodieplant.com — "Prefer email? Drop me a message about what you're working on."
- **Book a call**: Cal.com or Calendly link — "Want to talk it through? Book a 15-minute intro call." (Phase 2 — placeholder link for now)
- **LinkedIn**: Profile link — "Connect with me on LinkedIn"

#### 4. What to Expect

- "I respond to every enquiry within 24 hours"
- "Audit responses include a personalised assessment, not a generic template"
- "No pressure, no hard sell — just an honest conversation about whether I can help"

#### 5. Availability

- "Currently taking on 2 new clients for Q2 2026"
- Creates urgency without being pushy

## 10. Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | **Astro 5** | Already set up, excellent for static sites |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Rapid development, consistent design system |
| Hosting | **GitHub Pages** | Free, already configured via GitHub Actions |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** | Already configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |
| TypeScript | **Strict mode** | Already configured via `astro/tsconfigs/strict` |
| Forms | **Formspree** or **Formspark** | Static-site compatible, sends to email, free tier |

### AI Discoverability

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `llms.txt` | Curated AI-friendly index of key site content | `public/llms.txt` |
| `llms-full.txt` | Extended version with full page content in markdown | `public/llms-full.txt` (optional) |

**llms.txt** is a proposed convention for helping AI agents understand a site's most important content. It lists key pages with brief descriptions in clean markdown. **Reality check**: Google confirmed they don't use it, and no major AI company has officially adopted it. However, implementation cost is minimal and it's reasonable future-proofing. Yoast SEO and Webflow already support it. Treat as a low-priority technical add-on — not a substitute for authority, distribution, or third-party mentions.

Generate/update `llms.txt` as part of the build process or maintain manually. Include: homepage, services, about, results, contact, and blog posts (when they exist).

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.0s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 1.5s |
| Time to Interactive | < 2.0s |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | < 0.1 |
| PageSpeed Score | > 95 |

### Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Semantic HTML throughout
- Keyboard navigable
- Sufficient color contrast (verify orange on navy, orange on white)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for animations
- Screen reader compatible
- Form labels and ARIA attributes

## 11. Analytics & Integrations

### Decision: PostHog

PostHog is the analytics platform for this site. It provides a unified stack — product analytics, session recording, funnels, A/B testing — in a single tool. This avoids stitching together separate services and means all data lives in one place.

**Cost**: Free tier includes 1M events/month, 5K session recordings/month, and 1M feature flag requests/month. More than sufficient for an agency site.

**GDPR note**: PostHog uses cookies for session tracking. A cookie consent banner is **required** before initialising PostHog for EU visitors. The banner must be shipped alongside the PostHog integration — not deferred.

### MVP Analytics Stack

| Capability | Tool | Cost |
|------------|------|------|
| Analytics & events | **PostHog** | Free (1M events/mo) |
| Session recording | **PostHog** | Free (5K recordings/mo) |
| Funnels & goals | **PostHog** | Included |
| Form handling | **Formspree** or **Formspark** | Free tier (50 submissions/mo) |

### MVP Event Tracking (Comprehensive)

#### Automatic Events (PostHog autocapture)

PostHog autocapture handles clicks, page views, and form interactions automatically. However, we also define explicit custom events for the interactions that matter most — this ensures reliable funnel analysis even if autocapture config changes.

#### Custom Events — Page-Level

| Event | Trigger | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `$pageview` | Page load (automatic) | `path`, `referrer`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign` |
| `page_section_viewed` | Section scrolls into viewport | `section_id`, `page`, `viewport_percent` |
| `scroll_depth` | User scrolls past 25/50/75/100% | `depth_percent`, `page` |

#### Custom Events — CTA & Navigation

| Event | Trigger | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `cta_clicked` | Any CTA button click | `cta_text`, `cta_location` (hero/nav/footer/inline), `cta_destination`, `page` |
| `email_clicked` | mailto: link click | `location` (footer/contact/inline), `page` |
| `nav_clicked` | Navigation link click | `link_text`, `destination`, `is_mobile` |
| `service_card_clicked` | Service card click on homepage | `service_name`, `page` |
| `calendar_clicked` | Calendar booking link click | `location`, `page` |

#### Custom Events — Contact Form

| Event | Trigger | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `form_viewed` | Contact form scrolls into viewport | — |
| `form_started` | First form field focused | `first_field` |
| `form_field_completed` | Field loses focus with value | `field_name` |
| `form_abandoned` | User leaves page with partial form | `fields_completed`, `last_field` |
| `form_submitted` | Form successfully submitted | `budget_range`, `has_url`, `challenge_length` |
| `form_error` | Form validation error shown | `field_name`, `error_type` |

#### Custom Events — Content Engagement

| Event | Trigger | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `blog_post_read` | User scrolls past 75% of post | `post_slug`, `post_title`, `read_time_seconds` |
| `external_link_clicked` | Click on outbound link | `url`, `link_text`, `page` |

### Person Properties

Set these on the PostHog person profile to enable segmentation:

| Property | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `first_visit_page` | First pageview | Which page attracted them |
| `utm_source` | URL params | Attribution |
| `utm_medium` | URL params | Attribution |
| `utm_campaign` | URL params | Attribution |
| `visit_count` | Incremented each session | Engagement depth |
| `pages_viewed` | Array of visited pages | Interest profiling |
| `form_submitted` | Boolean | Conversion flag |
| `budget_range` | Form submission | Lead qualification |

### Cookie Consent

PostHog uses cookies. A consent banner **must** ship alongside PostHog — not deferred.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Banner trigger | Show on first visit, persist preference |
| Options | Accept / Reject (simple two-button) |
| Default behavior | PostHog NOT initialised until consent given |
| Storage | `localStorage` key `analytics_consent`, value `granted` or `denied` |
| Expiry | 1 year, then re-prompt |
| Privacy link | Links to /privacy page |
| Script behavior | If consent granted: load PostHog JS. If denied: do not load. If no choice yet: do not load |

**Implementation pattern**:
```
1. Page loads → check localStorage for consent
2. If no consent stored → show banner, do NOT load PostHog
3. If consent === 'granted' → initialise PostHog
4. If consent === 'denied' → do not load PostHog
5. On banner accept → store consent, initialise PostHog, dismiss banner
6. On banner reject → store denial, dismiss banner
```

### Conversion Funnels (Configure in PostHog)

**Primary funnel** (Homepage → Enquiry):
1. `$pageview` where `path = /`
2. `$pageview` where `path = /contact`
3. `form_started`
4. `form_submitted`

**Services exploration funnel**:
1. `$pageview` where `path = /`
2. `service_card_clicked` OR `$pageview` where `path = /services`
3. `$pageview` where `path = /contact`
4. `form_submitted`

**Content funnel** (Phase 2, when blog exists):
1. `$pageview` where `path starts with /blog`
2. `blog_post_read`
3. `cta_clicked` where `cta_location = blog_post`
4. `form_submitted`

### PostHog Dashboards

Create these saved dashboards in PostHog:

**Overview Dashboard**:
- Unique visitors (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Page views by page
- Bounce rate
- Average session duration
- Top referrers
- Device/browser breakdown

**Conversion Dashboard**:
- Primary funnel visualization
- Form submission count (daily trend)
- Email click count
- CTA click heatmap by location
- Form completion rate (started vs. submitted)
- Form abandonment by last field

**Content Dashboard** (Phase 2):
- Blog post views
- Read completion rate per post
- Blog → contact conversion rate
- Top posts by engagement

### Google Search Console

Not part of PostHog but required for organic search visibility:
- Verify domain ownership
- Submit XML sitemap
- Monitor indexing status
- Track search impressions, clicks, and average position
- Set up as Phase 2 (manual setup, not a code change)

### UTM Parameter Handling

All UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`) should be:
1. Captured from URL on page load
2. Stored as PostHog person properties for attribution
3. Included as properties on the `form_submitted` event
4. Preserved across page navigations within the session (PostHog handles this automatically)

This enables answering: "Which LinkedIn post / campaign / channel is driving actual enquiries?"

### Phase 2 Integrations

| Capability | Tool | Cost | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| Blog | **Astro Content Collections** | Free | Markdown-based, 2-3 seed posts |
| Live chat | **Crisp** | Free tier | Engage high-intent visitors |
| Calendar booking | **Cal.com** | Free | 15-min intro call booking |
| Email capture | **ConvertKit** or **Resend** | Free tier | Newsletter / lead nurture |
| Search Console | **Google Search Console** | Free | Organic search monitoring |

### Phase 3 Enhancements

- CRM integration (HubSpot Free or Notion)
- A/B testing via PostHog feature flags (headline variations, CTA copy)
- PostHog session recording analysis (watch where users get stuck)
- Cohort analysis (returning visitors vs. new)

---

## 12. SEO Requirements

### Technical SEO

- Proper `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` on all pages
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter card meta tags
- Canonical URLs
- XML sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`)
- `robots.txt`
- Structured data (Organization, LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, Article, HowTo)
- Alt text on all images
- Semantic HTML headings hierarchy
- Clean URL structure (no trailing slashes, lowercase)

### Meta Tag Templates

**Homepage**:
- Title: "Jodie Plant Marketing — AI-Powered Marketing for Tech Companies"
- Description: "Full-service digital marketing for startups and tech companies. SEO, paid ads, social media, content, and analytics — powered by AI, delivered by a senior marketer."

**Services**:
- Title: "Services — Jodie Plant Marketing"
- Description: "AI-enhanced SEO & GEO, content marketing, paid advertising, social media, email, analytics, and AI workflow consulting for startups and tech companies."

**About**:
- Title: "About — Jodie Plant Marketing"
- Description: "Meet Jodie Plant. Senior digital marketer helping tech companies grow with AI-enhanced, full-service marketing. One marketer. Full attention. Real results."

**Results**:
- Title: "Results — Jodie Plant Marketing"
- Description: "See how Jodie Plant Marketing delivers results for tech companies. Real credentials, proven methodology, and a track record of measurable growth."

**Contact**:
- Title: "Get Your Free Marketing Audit — Jodie Plant Marketing"
- Description: "Get a free, personalised marketing audit for your startup. Tell me about your business and I'll show you where I'd focus first."

### GEO / Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

> SEO is expanding into Generative Engine Optimization. The site itself should practice what Jodie sells. See `MARKET_RESEARCH_2026.md` Part 2 for full context, including the SEO vs GEO comparison table.

**Content structured for machine understanding:**
- Answer questions directly in the first paragraph (AI-extractable)
- Use clear heading hierarchies (H2, H3, H4)
- Include specific data, statistics, and citations
- Use natural conversational language (matching how people talk to AI)
- Implement comprehensive schema markup (Organization, Article, FAQPage, HowTo)
- **Update core content every 90 days** — freshness matters for AI citation

**"Best answer" page strategy**: Key pages should directly and completely answer buyer questions — not just target keywords.

**Tactics for this site**:
- Service pages structured as clear Q&A: "What does an SEO engagement include?", "How much does startup marketing cost?", "What's the difference between an agency and a freelancer?"
- FAQ sections on service pages with structured data (`FAQPage` schema)
- Comparison-style content: "Agency vs freelancer vs in-house" (already partly covered in Section 6)
- Results page methodology walkthroughs serve as "how we do it" proof assets

**Entity authority** (more important than keyword volume):
- Consistent brand presence across the web (website, LinkedIn, directories, Reddit, industry forums)
- If the brand appears across multiple credible sources, AI systems gain "confidence" in recommending it
- Verified reviews, case studies, and testimonials are trust signals for AI systems
- Third-party mentions (PR, partners, reviews, communities)

**AI citation monitoring**: Track how and where the brand appears in AI answers.
- Tools: Semrush AIO, Otterly.ai, Ahrefs Brand Radar, Brandi AI
- Check what AI systems say when asked about marketing agencies / consultants in the target niche

**llms.txt**: Add `/llms.txt` — a curated, AI-friendly index of the site's key content in clean markdown. See Section 10 for implementation. **Important caveat**: Google's John Mueller confirmed Google Search doesn't use llms.txt. No major AI company has officially adopted it. It's useful for developer docs and RAG systems, and implementation cost is minimal, but it is **not a citation factor** — treat as future-proofing, not a strategy.

**Success metrics beyond rankings**:
- Branded search volume (are more people searching "Jodie Plant Marketing"?)
- Direct traffic growth
- Assisted conversions (visitors who saw content before converting)
- AI citation monitoring (share of voice in AI answers — what do ChatGPT/Perplexity say?)
- Lead quality (not just quantity)

### Phase 2: Blog (`/blog`) — Priority

**Purpose**: Build authority, drive organic traffic, demonstrate the expertise being sold. A marketer without a blog is like a chef without a menu.

**Structure**:
- Blog listing page with featured post
- Individual post pages with clean reading experience
- Categories/tags for filtering
- CTA at end of each post ("Want help implementing this? Get your free audit")

**Seed posts** (launch with 2-3):
1. "How to build a marketing strategy for your seed-stage startup"
2. "SEO vs paid ads: where should startups spend first?"
3. "What an AI-powered marketing workflow actually looks like"

**Content cadence**: 2-4 posts per month (achievable with AI-assisted workflow).

**Technical**: Use Astro Content Collections with markdown files.

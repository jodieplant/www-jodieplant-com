## The Main Shift

AI Overviews and other "zero-click" experiences are reducing the share of searches that turn into website visits. The game is moving from **"rank and get clicks"** to **"be the brand and source that gets referenced, remembered, and chosen"** across search, AI answers, socials, and communities.

Independent studies show AI summaries/Overviews reduce organic click-through rates meaningfully, and Pew research found users click links less when an AI summary is present.

## What Companies Need Most Right Now

### 1. Demand Capture Basics (Highest ROI Foundation)

**What it includes:**
- Website conversion tune-up (messaging, proof, offers, speed, mobile)
- Landing pages for 1-3 core offers
- Analytics that answer "where leads came from" and "what converts"
- Lead capture + follow-up (forms, email, calendar booking, CRM hygiene)

**Why it sells:** Most SMB sites leak leads. Fixable fast, results measurable in weeks.

**Typical goals:** More qualified inbound leads, better conversion rate (same traffic, more inquiries), clarity on attribution.

**Timelines:** Setup 1-3 weeks; first conversion lift 2-6 weeks (often sooner if traffic exists).

### 2. Local and Reputation Growth

**What it includes:**
- Google Business Profile optimization
- Review generation system (email/SMS prompts, routing)
- Local pages and service area pages
- Citation cleanup and NAP consistency

**Why it sells:** Directly tied to calls, directions, bookings.

**Timelines:** 2-8 weeks for noticeable movement; ongoing compounding.

### 3. Content Designed for AI Answers (GEO/AEO) and Humans

**What it includes:**
- "Best answer" pages (pricing, comparisons, alternatives, how-it-works, FAQs)
- Proof assets: case studies, benchmarks, "how we do it" playbooks
- Content distribution plan (LinkedIn, YouTube, newsletters, partners)
- Structured data and clean site architecture

**Why it sells:** SEO isn't dead, but clicks are less reliable. Content must earn trust even when it isn't clicked.

**Timelines:** 30-90 days to start seeing meaningful traction, then compounding.

### 4. "Owned Audience" Systems (Email + Community + Referral)

**What it includes:**
- Newsletter + lead magnets that are genuinely useful
- Simple nurture sequences (welcome, education, "book a call")
- Referral loops (customer referral, partner referral)

**Why it sells:** Reduces dependence on ads and platform volatility.

**Timelines:** 2-4 weeks to launch; 2-3 months to see consistent lead flow if distribution is real.

### 5. Partnerships and Distribution

**What it includes:**
- Newsletter sponsorships in the niche
- Podcast guesting / sponsorships
- Influencer/creator micro-partnerships (B2B and local both work)
- Affiliate or referral partner deals

**Why it sells:** You can often buy trust and attention cheaper than buying clicks.

**Timelines:** 2-6 weeks to book placements; 1-3 months to validate a repeatable channel.

## Budget Tiers (What Buyers Expect in 2026)

Marketing budgets average about 7.7% of revenue (Gartner 2025 CMO survey). Many SMBs plan to maintain or increase spend despite uncertainty.

### Tier 1: $0-$1,500/month (Micro-SMB, Solopreneurs)

- **Wants:** "basic presence + leads"
- **Best sell:** local profile + reviews + one great landing page + simple email follow-up
- **Timeline expectation:** "I need leads this month" (manage scope tightly)

### Tier 2: $1,500-$5,000/month (Typical SMB Services)

- **Wants:** reliable inbound leads, clearer positioning, attribution
- **Best sell:** conversion system + local + 1-2 content pillars + light paid tests
- **Timeline expectation:** first measurable wins in 30-60 days

### Tier 3: $5,000-$15,000/month (Serious SMB / Early Startup)

- **Wants:** a repeatable pipeline, content engine, channel experiments
- **Best sell:** measurement + conversion + content designed for AI/humans + partnerships + disciplined paid
- **Timeline expectation:** channel validation in 60-120 days

### Tier 4: $15,000+/month (Growth-Stage)

- **Wants:** scale, multi-channel, creative production, experimentation, reporting
- **Usually expects:** quarterly planning cycles

## GEO/AEO: What Is Replacing Traditional SEO

Not replacing — expanding. SEO is being forced to merge with "answer engines" and AI discovery.

**Common names:** Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), LLM Optimization (LLMO), AI Optimization (AIO).

### What Changes Tactically

You still need crawlable pages and topical authority, but you also need:
- **"Best answer" pages** that directly resolve buyer questions
- **Credible third-party mentions** (PR, partners, reviews, communities)
- **Strong brand signals** and consistent positioning across the web

Because click-through is getting squeezed by AI summaries/Overviews, success is measured more by:
- Branded search lift
- Assisted conversions
- Direct traffic
- Lead quality
- Not just rankings

### llms.txt

A proposed convention: a curated, AI-friendly index of a site's most important content, in clean text/markdown form, meant to help AI agents understand what matters.

**Pragmatic view:**
- "Nice-to-have" alongside clean sitemap, good internal linking, solid content structure
- Not a substitute for authority, distribution, or being mentioned by credible sources
- Treat as a small technical add-on in a broader GEO plan

## Alternatives to High-Budget Google/Meta Ads

"Cheaper attention + higher intent + trust transfer."

1. **Partnerships and referrals** — Channel partners, referral incentives, co-marketed webinars. Often the best CAC. Warm leads with lower sales friction.

2. **Newsletter sponsorships and niche media buys** — Buy attention where the niche actually pays attention. Predictable top-of-funnel at lower CPMs than broad social.

3. **Podcast guesting and sponsorships** — Especially strong for professional services and B2B. Trust transfer and high-quality inbound.

4. **LinkedIn organic + "founder-led" content (B2B)** — POV posts, case studies, teardowns, build-in-public. Pipeline without auction pricing.

5. **Community marketing** — Reddit, Slack/Discord communities, industry forums. Show up with real answers, publish helpful assets. Credibility and discovery.

6. **Productized offers + outbound** — Tight offer like "Landing page + tracking + 2-week lead sprint." Highly targeted outreach to narrow ICP. Fastest path when organic takes time.

7. **Local services: maps + reviews + local pages** — Still one of the most underpriced lead sources for SMB services.

## Implications for Jodie's Website

### Service Positioning
The current channel-based services (SEO, PPC, Social, Content, Email, Analytics) are table stakes. What differentiates is packaging them into **outcome-based offerings** that match buyer language: "I need leads", "I need to be found locally", "I need to show up in AI answers."

### Content Strategy
Blog and content should be "best answer" format — directly answering buyer questions with proof, specifics, and genuine expertise. This serves both human readers and AI citation.

### SEO Strategy
Expand from traditional SEO to GEO/AEO. Add llms.txt. Measure branded search and direct traffic alongside rankings. Build "best answer" pages.

### Lead Magnet
The "Free Marketing Audit" is well-positioned — it maps directly to the "demand capture basics" service that has the highest close rate. Could also productize as a "Conversion & Tracking Audit" for even more specificity.

## The Market Opportunity

The timing is excellent for a new agency:

- **68% of SMBs plan to increase marketing budgets** in 2026 (Constant Contact Q1 2026, 1,500+ SMB owners). Only 14% expect decreases.
- **74% expect to spend more time on marketing** — even with inflation as their top concern.
- **54% of SMB owners already use AI marketing tools**, but most don't know how to use them strategically.
- **Social media (68%) is the #1 channel** SMBs say will drive the most business. Email (41%) is second.

**The gap:** SMBs need a guide, not just a doer. They have tools but lack strategy.

## The AI Search Shift

AI Overviews and zero-click experiences are reducing the share of searches that turn into website visits. The game is moving from **"rank and get clicks"** to **"be the brand that gets referenced, remembered, and chosen"** across search, AI answers, socials, and communities.

**Scale of the shift:**
- ChatGPT: 800M+ weekly active users
- Google Gemini: 750M+ monthly users (plus 2B via AI Overviews)
- Perplexity: 45M+ monthly users
- Gartner predicts a **25% drop in traditional search volume** due to AI chatbots

Independent studies show AI summaries/Overviews reduce organic CTR meaningfully, and Pew research found users click links less when an AI summary is present.

As LinkedIn's Big Ideas 2026 put it: the goal is no longer to "rank" but to be **"cited" as a trusted source within AI responses**.

## Part 1: Services SMBs & Startups Actually Need

> **Note:** The 7 service areas below represent market demand categories. The website brief (`WEBSITE_BRIEF.md` Section 5) repackages these into 8 canonical services: SEO & GEO, AI Implementation & Workflow Consulting, Content Marketing, Paid Advertising (Beyond Google & Meta), Social Media & Short-Form Video, Local Visibility & Reputation, Email Marketing & Owned Audience, Analytics & Reporting.

### Tier 1 — High Demand, Immediate Need

#### 1. AI-Ready Content Strategy & GEO

The single biggest shift in digital marketing right now. Traditional SEO isn't dead, but it's no longer sufficient. GEO — optimizing content so AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, Gemini) cite and recommend your brand — is the new frontier.

**What the service looks like:**
- Audit existing content for AI-readability (structure, schema markup, entity clarity)
- Rewrite/restructure key pages to be "citation-worthy" — clear answers, data-backed claims, original insights
- "Best answer" pages (pricing, comparisons, alternatives, how-it-works, FAQs)
- Build entity authority across the web (consistent brand presence on directories, social, Reddit, industry forums)
- Schema markup implementation (Organization, Article, FAQPage, HowTo)
- Monitor AI mentions using Semrush AIO, Otterly.ai, or Ahrefs Brand Radar
- Content distribution plan (LinkedIn, YouTube, newsletters, partners)

**Client goal:** Be cited in AI-generated answers, not just rank in Google.
**Budget range:** $1,500–$5,000/month retainer.
**Timeline:** 3–6 months for measurable AI visibility improvements; 30–90 days for "best answer" content traction.

#### 2. Social Media Management & Short-Form Video

Social media (68%) is the #1 channel SMBs say will drive the most business in 2026. Short-form video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts) continues to dominate engagement.

**What the service looks like:**
- Content calendar & strategy for 2–3 platforms
- Short-form video creation (talking-head, B-roll with text overlays)
- Community management (responding, engaging)
- Monthly analytics & reporting

**Client goal:** Brand awareness, engagement, lead generation.
**Budget range:** $500–$3,000/month (freelancer/solo); $1,000–$5,000/month (small agency).
**Timeline:** Month-to-month, results build over 3–6 months.

#### 3. Email Marketing & Automation

The second most valuable channel for SMBs. With privacy changes killing third-party targeting, first-party data (email lists) is now the most valuable marketing asset a business owns.

**What the service looks like:**
- Email strategy & list-building
- Automated sequences (welcome, nurture, re-engagement, post-purchase)
- Campaign creation & management
- Segmentation & personalization
- Newsletter + lead magnets that are genuinely useful
- Referral loops (customer referral, partner referral)

**Client goal:** Customer retention, repeat purchases, nurturing leads. Reduce dependence on ads.
**Budget range:** $500–$2,500/month.
**Timeline:** Setup 2–4 weeks; ongoing optimization. 2–3 months for consistent lead flow.

#### 4. Demand Capture Basics (Highest ROI Foundation)

Most SMB sites leak leads. This is fixable fast, and results are measurable in weeks.

**What the service looks like:**
- Website conversion tune-up (messaging, proof, offers, speed, mobile)
- Landing pages for 1–3 core offers
- Analytics that answer "where leads came from" and "what converts"
- Lead capture + follow-up (forms, email, calendar booking, CRM hygiene)

**Client goal:** More qualified inbound leads, better conversion rate, clarity on attribution.
**Budget range:** $1,000–$3,000 fixed-fee; or included in retainer.
**Timeline:** Setup 1–3 weeks; first conversion lift 2–6 weeks.

### Tier 2 — Growing Demand, Strategic Value

#### 5. Local SEO & Google Business Profile Optimization

Still critical for service businesses. AI search engines also pull from local listings and reviews as trust signals.

**What the service looks like:**
- Google Business Profile setup/optimization
- Apple Maps & other directory management
- Review generation & response strategy (email/SMS prompts, routing)
- Local content creation and service area pages
- Citation building and NAP consistency

**Client goal:** Show up in local search & AI local recommendations. More calls, directions, bookings.
**Budget range:** $500–$2,000/month.
**Timeline:** 1–3 months for visible improvement; ongoing compounding.

#### 6. AI Implementation & Workflow Consulting

45% of SMBs now use AI to analyze trends; 44% use it to compose content. But most are scratching the surface. Consulting on integrating AI tools into marketing workflows is a high-value, differentiated service.

**What the service looks like:**
- Audit current marketing processes
- Recommend & set up AI tools (content creation, analytics, automation)
- Train team on effective AI usage
- Build SOPs for AI-assisted workflows

**Client goal:** Do more with less, increase efficiency.
**Budget range:** $1,000–$5,000 project fee, or $500–$2,000/month advisory.
**Timeline:** 2–4 week implementation sprint.

#### 7. Partnerships and Distribution

Often the cheapest "paid media." You can buy trust and attention cheaper than buying clicks.

**What the service looks like:**
- Newsletter sponsorships in the niche ($200–$1,000 per placement)
- Podcast guesting / sponsorships ($200–$500 for niche podcasts)
- Micro-influencer partnerships ($100–$500 per post for 1K–50K follower creators)
- Affiliate or referral partner deals
- Co-marketed webinars

**Client goal:** Warm leads with lower sales friction. Predictable top-of-funnel.
**Budget range:** $500–$2,000/month + media costs.
**Timeline:** 2–6 weeks to book placements; 1–3 months to validate.

## Part 2: GEO/AEO — The Evolution of SEO

### Traditional SEO vs GEO

| | Traditional SEO | GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Rank in search results | Be cited in AI-generated answers |
| **Metric** | Rankings, clicks, traffic | Citations, mentions, share of voice in AI |
| **Optimized for** | Google's crawlers & algorithm | LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) |
| **Key tactics** | Keywords, backlinks, technical SEO | Entity authority, structured data, citation-worthy content |
| **Content style** | Keyword-rich, comprehensive | Clear, extractable, data-backed, answer-first |

### What GEO Requires in Practice

**Content structured for machine understanding:**
- Answer questions directly in the first paragraph
- Use clear heading hierarchies (H2, H3, H4)
- Include specific data, statistics, and citations
- Use natural conversational language (matching how people talk to AI)
- Implement comprehensive schema markup (Organization, Article, FAQPage, HowTo)
- Update core content every 90 days

**Entity authority matters more than keyword volume:**
- Consistent brand presence across the web (website, LinkedIn, directories, Reddit, industry forums)
- If your brand appears across multiple credible sources, AI systems gain "confidence" in recommending you
- Verified reviews, case studies, and testimonials are trust signals for AI systems
- Credible third-party mentions (PR, partners, reviews, communities)

**Success metrics beyond rankings:**
- Branded search volume lift
- Direct traffic growth
- Assisted conversions
- AI citation monitoring (share of voice in AI answers)
- Lead quality, not just quantity

**What the industry calls it:**
- GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) — most common term
- AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) — gaining traction
- LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization)
- "Search Everywhere Optimization"

### llms.txt — Honest Assessment

**What it is:** A proposed text file (like robots.txt) placed in a site's root directory that guides AI systems to key content. Written in Markdown, acts as a curated index for LLMs.

**The reality in 2026:**
- It is **NOT** a ranking or citation factor. Google's John Mueller confirmed Google Search doesn't use it. No major AI company (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral) has officially adopted it.
- It **IS** useful for developer documentation sites where coding assistants and RAG systems actively ingest structured content.
- Yoast SEO has added one-click auto-generation; Webflow supports uploading it.
- Implementation cost is minimal — reasonable "future-proofing."
- The more realistic path to AI visibility: strong content fundamentals, schema markup, and entity authority.

**Recommendation:** Don't ignore it — it's easy to implement and low-risk. But don't prioritize it over the fundamentals (structured content, schema markup, entity building). Think of it as a bonus, not a strategy.

### What Jodie Should Offer: Combined GEO + SEO Package

This is the most compelling positioning for 2026. It signals understanding of the shift while not abandoning proven SEO fundamentals.

**Deliverables:**
- AI Visibility Audit (how does the brand appear when you ask ChatGPT/Perplexity about their industry?)
- Content restructuring for AI-readability
- Schema markup implementation
- Entity authority building plan
- Traditional SEO technical fixes
- Monthly AI citation monitoring
- llms.txt setup (as part of technical optimization, not as a headline feature)

## Part 3: Alternatives to High-Budget Google & Meta Ads

Google and Meta CPCs keep climbing. For SMBs/startups with budgets under $5K/month, there are stronger plays.

### Paid Alternatives (with CPCs)

| Platform | Avg CPC | Best For | Minimum Budget | Key Advantage |
|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Microsoft/Bing** | ~60% lower than Google | Finance, travel, healthcare, professional services | ~$500/month | Audience skews 35+, higher purchasing power. LinkedIn integration for B2B |
| **Reddit** | ~$0.20 | B2B, SaaS, tech, gaming, hobbyist markets | ~$200–500/month | Subreddit targeting = hyper-niche audiences |
| **Quora** | $0.35–$0.75 | B2B, SaaS, professional services, education | ~$300–500/month | Intent-driven audience (actively researching) |
| **TikTok** | Varies | Visual/consumer products, younger demographics | ~$500/month | Creates demand (doesn't just capture it). Spark Ads are low-cost |
| **Pinterest** | Lower than Meta | Home, food, fashion, wellness, DIY, events | ~$300–500/month | Users in "planning and buying" mode — high purchase intent |
| **LinkedIn** | $5–12+ | B2B services, consulting, SaaS with higher ACV | ~$1,000/month | Unmatched professional targeting (job title, company size, seniority) |

### Organic/Owned Alternatives

1. **Micro-influencer partnerships** — 1K–50K followers. More trusted and affordable ($100–$500/post). Often willing to do product exchanges or affiliate deals.

2. **Community-led growth** — Reddit, Discord, Facebook Groups, industry forums. Free but requires consistent participation. Works for SaaS, B2B, niche consumer.

3. **Newsletter sponsorships** — $200–$1,000 per placement. High engagement rates (much higher than display). Tools: Swapstack, Paved, direct outreach.

4. **Podcast advertising** — 15% of podcasters monetize — opportunity for affordable sponsorships. Host-read ads have uniquely high trust. Entry: $200–$500 for niche podcasts.

5. **LinkedIn organic + founder-led content (B2B)** — POV posts, case studies, teardowns, build-in-public. Pipeline without auction pricing.

6. **Content-led SEO + GEO** — Compounding returns. Takes 3–6 months but zero marginal cost per lead once established. The "rent vs. own" argument.

7. **Local: maps + reviews + local pages** — Still one of the most underpriced lead sources for SMB services.

### Smart Stack Budget Allocations

Instead of dumping everything into Google/Meta:

| Monthly Budget | Recommended Allocation |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **$2K** | $800 content/GEO + $600 email + $600 one paid channel (Bing or Reddit) |
| **$3K** | $1,000 content/GEO + $800 email + $600 social + $600 paid (Reddit + Bing) |
| **$5K** | $1,500 content/GEO + $1,000 email + $1,000 social + $1,500 paid (2–3 channels) |

## Part 5: Competitive Positioning Recommendations

### What makes a solopreneur agency win in 2026

1. **Lead with GEO expertise.** Most agencies are still selling "SEO." Position as "the agency that gets you cited by AI" — genuinely differentiated and forward-looking.

2. **Specialize in 1–2 verticals first.** Build deep case studies fast in: local services, B2B SaaS, wellness/health, real estate, or professional services.

3. **Use AI as a force multiplier, not a crutch.** AI tools let a solo operator deliver agency-quality work. Clients pay for judgment, not just output. Human strategy + AI execution.

4. **Results-based language.** Frame everything around outcomes, not deliverables. Not "12 posts per month" but "build your brand's AI citation presence and drive 30 qualified leads/month."

5. **Build her own GEO presence.** Practice what she preaches — make sure when someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity about marketing consultants, Jodie's name comes up.

6. **Start with 3–5 clients at mid-tier pricing.** Don't race to the bottom. Charge for value from day one.

## Implications for Jodie's Website

### Service Positioning
Channel-based services (SEO, PPC, Social, Content, Email, Analytics) are table stakes. Differentiate by packaging into **outcome-based offerings** that match buyer language and adding **GEO as a headline differentiator**. Lead with "I get you cited by AI" not "I do SEO."

### Service Packages
Move from channel-based to tiered packages (Foundation/Growth/Authority) and outcome-based packages (Conversion Setup, Local Visibility, AI-Ready Content, Partnerships). Both framings serve different buyer types.

### Content Strategy
Blog and content should be "best answer" format — directly answering buyer questions with proof, specifics, and genuine expertise. This serves both human readers and AI citation. Include short-form video in social/content strategy.

### SEO → GEO Strategy
Expand from traditional SEO to GEO/AEO. Implement schema markup comprehensively. Build entity authority. Monitor AI citations. llms.txt is a low-priority add-on, not a strategy. Measure branded search and direct traffic alongside rankings.

### Paid Media Positioning
Position as an expert in **efficient paid media** — not just Google/Meta but the full spectrum of lower-cost alternatives. The smart stack approach (spreading budget across content/email/social/paid) is a differentiator vs agencies that default to Google Ads.

### Lead Magnet
The "Free Marketing Audit" is well-positioned. Could also productize the "AI Visibility Audit" ($500–$1,500) as both a lead magnet and a paid entry point.

### Vertical Specialization
Consider highlighting 1–2 target verticals on the site to build credibility faster. Tech/SaaS startups and local service businesses are the strongest fits.
